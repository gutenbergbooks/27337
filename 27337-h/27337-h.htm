<h3>THE KID AMATEUR</h3>

<p>Gerard paused on the steps of the cement
plateau overlooking the racetrack, his eyebrows
lifting in the wave of humor glinting across his
face like sunlight over quiet water.</p>

<p>"What?" he wondered. "Who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The grinning mechanician who had just come
across from the row of training-camps opposite
supplied the information.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Rose's rose. Ain't he awful
tweet?" he mocked.</p>

<p>Gerard continued to smile, but his clear amber
eyes grew keenly appraising as they followed the
flight of the rose-colored racing car around the
circular track.</p>

<p>"He can drive," he gave laconic verdict.</p>

<p>"Sure," assented the mechanician. "But he'll
be the last rose of summer, all right, when the race
comes off. He'll not last twenty-four hours&mdash;a
kid amateur. If you ain't coming over, I'll lead
myself back to my job."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"You never can tell," warned Gerard, tolerantly.
"No, I'm not coming over, Rupert; run
along."</p>

<p>He moved over to one of the grand-stand seats,
as he spoke, and sat down, leaning on the rail
with an easy movement of his supple figure. That
was the first characteristic strangers usually noted
in him: an exquisite Hellenic grace of strength
and faultless proportion. He was a man's beauty,
as distinguished from a beauty-man; other men
were given to admiring him extravagantly and unresentfully.
Unresentfully, because of his utter
practicality and matter-of-fact atmosphere.</p>

<p>The afternoon sunshine glittered goldenly across
the huge, green field and the mile track circling
it, where four racing cars sped in practice contest.
Two of them were painted gray, one was
dingy-white; the fourth shone in delicate pink
enamel touched here and there with silver-gilt.
Its driver and mechanician were clad in pink also,
adding the completing stroke to an effect suggesting
the circus rather than the race track. There
was much excuse for the laughter of the camps,
and that reflection of it lying in Gerard's eyes.</p>

<p>Yet, the rose-colored machine was well driven.
More than once the watcher nodded in quick approval
of a skilful turn or deft man&#339;uvre. Once he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
rose and changed his position to see more distinctly,
and it was then that he first noticed the girl.</p>

<p>She was so beautifully and expensively gowned
as to draw even masculine notice of the fact, the
veil that fell from her silk hood to the hem of
her cloak would alone have purchased the motor
costume of the average woman. Against this filmy
drapery her intent face showed as a study in
concentration; her dark-blue eyes wide behind
their black lashes, her soft lips apart, she too
was watching the pink racer. But there was no
laughter in her expression, instead there was the
most deep and earnest tenderness, a blending of
the childish and the maternal that made Gerard
catch his breath and glance enviously at the driver
of the gaudy car.</p>

<p>The afternoon was almost ended; as Gerard
looked, the pink machine finished its last circuit
and plunged through the paddock entrance, to
come to a halt before its own tent in the "white
city" of training camps. Simultaneously the girl
in the upper rows of seats arose, catching up her
swirl of pale silk and lace garments and hurrying
precipitately down the stairway aisle. So great
was her haste that, coming suddenly to the last
step, one small, high-heeled su&egrave;de shoe slipped
from the iron edge and flung her violently against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
a column of the stand. Gerard reached her just
in time to prevent further fall.</p>

<p>"Stand still," he cautioned, quietly steady.
"There is a second flight of stairs. You are not
hurt, I hope?"</p>

<p>Giddy, for a moment she willingly suffered his
support, then drew back on the narrow landing,
her color returning vividly.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. "I am not hurt. I thank
you very much."</p>

<p>Thick waves of fair hair lay across her forehead
above the delicate dark line of her brows,
her candid regard met his with the dignity of
utter naturalness and a young confidence in the
goodness of all men. The impression Gerard
received was original; he fancied that her home life
must have been singularly happy and innocent,
and that he should like to know her father.</p>

<p>"You will let me take you down the rest of
the way, at least," he offered, accepting the
situation as simply as she had done.</p>

<p>She glanced down the stairs with a slight shiver,
still shaken and unnerved.</p>

<p>"You are very good. My car is beyond the
corner, there. I&mdash;I am in haste to reach it."</p>

<p class="caption">GIDDY, SHE WILLINGLY SUFFERED HIS SUPPORT, THEN DREW BACK, HER COLOR
RETURNING VIVIDLY</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>That had been obvious. Yet, as she laid her
gloved hand on Gerard's arm, she lingered to
look again in the direction of the training-camps.</p>

<p>"The cars will not go out again to-day?" she
inferred, half-questioningly.</p>

<p>"No, I think not. It is already late. This
way?"</p>

<p>"Please; to the rear of the club-house."</p>

<p>They descended to the lower floor and crossed
a strip of sandy ground to where a large foreign-built
touring car waited, empty save for the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>"I am running away from my brother," the
young girl explained; then, with a playfulness
tinged with pathos, "He is practicing out there.
And it vexes him if I watch him or say I am
afraid for him. He tells me to stay home and
forget it. But sometimes I cannot. To-day I
could not. Thanks to you, I shall escape before
he finds me."</p>

<p>The "kid amateur's" sister, of course, Gerard
thought, as he put her in the car.</p>

<p>"Do you always do as he says?" he queried
whimsically. "I have no sister, but I did not
understand that was the rule."</p>

<p>She turned to him her soft, completely feminine
face, and gleamed into laughter.</p>

<p>"I am the only passive member of a strong-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>willed
family," she told him. "I am always doing
what some one bids. Thank you, and good-by."</p>

<p>The margin of safe escape was not great. As
Gerard stepped back on the cement promenade,
the pink machine shot across and came to a halt
near the exit, its driver turning in his seat.</p>

<p>"Any one going to town?" he called, his imperious
young voice ringing across the open spaces.</p>

<p>"No," came the discouraging monosyllable from
the official stand.</p>

<p>"No one?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The driver slowly sent his car forward,
temper in every crisp movement, his gaze travelling
over the empty tiers of seats, to fall at last
upon Gerard and there rest. With a jerk he
jammed down the brake and leaned from the
machine. Thick fair hair lay across his boyish
forehead above level dark brows, his candid dark-blue
eyes went direct to their goal: the metal
badge fastened to Gerard's lapel and just visible
under the edge of his gray overcoat.</p>

<p>"You're wearing a chauffeur's license," he
challenged.</p>

<p>"I surely am. Want to engage a man?" was
the grave response.</p>

<p>The boy's arch glance swept the other's face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
so definitely stamped with the habit of mastery.</p>

<p>"If I did I'd ask you to recommend one," he
retorted mirthfully. "I'm not as much mixed as
I sounded; I wasn't thinking of hiring you. But
I did want to ask if you would ride into the city
with me. My mechanician is busy over there, I
can't find any one else to go with me, and I've
got to get my car down to the Renard shop to-night."</p>

<p>"Now I wonder," Gerard mused aloud, "why
you want any one with you."</p>

<p>"Because I won't be eighteen for a month,"
he gave prompt explanation. "Under the latest
law freak turned out at Albany, I'm too young
to drive a motor vehicle safely on the public roads
unless I have a licensed chauffeur alongside of me.
Oh, of course you'd laugh!"</p>

<p>"I was only recalling what I've just been
watching you do on the track," apologized Gerard,
steadying his countenance. "And speculating
upon how the average chauffeur would like to try
your feats. I shall appreciate the honor of riding
into town with Mr. Rose and his rose."</p>

<p>The driver colored and laughed together, as
his guest took the seat beside him.</p>

<p>"They're always ragging me&mdash;I mean the professional
racers and motor men," he avowed, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
a burst of resentful confidence. "They called
me kid amateur, and rosebud, and girlie, until I
just had my car painted pink and bought these
pink suits and told them to go ahead getting all
the fun they could. I'll get my turn to-morrow
night." He twisted his car through the curved
gateway, viciously expert.</p>

<p>"You are planning to win?"</p>

<p>There was no trace of mockery in the level
intonation of the inquiry, yet Rose flushed again.</p>

<p>"I want to, and I mean to try," he answered
frankly and soberly. "Of course one can't count
on that sort of thing. I've got a splendid French
machine here. But Allan Gerard is going to race;
I'm afraid of him. Why, he hasn't even been out to
practice! He says he knows the track, they tell
me, and he'll not come down until a couple of
hours before the start. That kind of talk <i>rattles</i>
me&mdash;I wish he'd act like other people and not as if
he just meant to drop into the motordrome and
win another cup."</p>

<p>"I don't believe Gerard intends to pose as
confident," deprecated his companion. "You see,
he has his automobile factory to manage as well
as his racing work; I rather fancy that he didn't
come out to practice because he was busy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose so. It just gets on my nerves;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
I shouldn't wonder if they were a bit raw from
so much chaffing by the professional pilots. We're
the quickest tempered family that ever happened,
anyhow. I'll go off the handle, I know I will, if
those grinning drivers get to gibing at me to-morrow
night&mdash;&mdash;" he broke off, slamming savagely
into a lower gear as he caught a mounted
policeman's eye and endeavored to choke his racing
car's speed down to a reasonable approach to
the legal limit.</p>

<p>When the desired result was somewhat attained,
Gerard spoke with quiet seriousness.</p>

<p>"I've seen considerable motor racing, and I've
been watching you this afternoon. With some
really steady training and practice you could undoubtedly
become one of our few fine drivers. You
have the gift."</p>

<p>Rose caught his breath, his blue eyes flashed to
meet the other man's with dazzled and dazzling
ardor.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you must not 'go off the handle.'
Never. You must keep your nerve or quit the
track."</p>

<p>"It isn't nerve, it's temper," amended Rose
honestly.</p>

<p>Gerard's firm lip bent amusedly, his bronze-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>brown
eyes glinted a fun as purely boyish as could
the other's.</p>

<p>"That's quite different," he conceded. "Temper
doesn't interfere with driving; on the contrary,
some of the best drivers and most amiable
men I know are very demons when they are racing."</p>

<p>"Gerard isn't. They say he is the quietest
ever. Of course he's almost twenty-eight and used
to it all."</p>

<p>The gentleman in question carefully unfastened
his glove.</p>

<p>"Gerard seems to worry you," he commented.</p>

<p>"He does. I don't know just why, but he does."</p>

<p>"Well, don't let him. This is where you leave
your machine?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I can't offer to take you wherever you
are going, because I couldn't get back alone. I'm
awfully obliged to you for coming in with me."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the ride." Gerard stepped out
and offered his hand with a glance deliberately
friendly. "Good-by; good luck for to-morrow
and next day."</p>

<p>Rose dragged off his gauntlet and eagerly bent
to give the clasp.</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;you're not going like that?" he protested.
"I'd like to see you again. You haven't
told me <i>your</i> name."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will see each other again. That's a safe
prediction, I assure you." He withdrew his hand,
laughing a denial of explanation as he retreated.
"I will tell you my name next time, if you ask
me."</p>

<p>Already half a dozen people had collected
around the pink racing car. Others were flocking
from every direction, the group forming with a
suddenness truly New Yorkese. Indifferent to all,
Rose sprang out of his seat and ran through the
curious men in pursuit of his late companion.</p>

<p>"Wait," he urged, overtaking him. "I want
to ask&mdash;did you mean that? About my driving
well, some day? I know I'll never get a chance
to do it, but do you mean that I <i>could</i>?"</p>

<p>"I meant," confirmed Gerard, "just what I
said. I usually do. Good-by."</p>

<p>The boy remained perfectly still in the midst
of the crowd, standing in his rose-colored costume
and looking after the straight, slender figure swinging
down the street. When Gerard glanced back
in turning the corner, Rose was still watching him.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was some forty-five hours later that Gerard's
prediction was verified, in the glare-streaked darkness
of the Beach racetrack amid the medley
of sounds from excited crowds, roaring cars, and
noisily busy training camps. Under the swinging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
electric light before the hospital tent, the two
drivers came face to face.</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong, I hope?" Gerard greeted,
keen eyes sweeping the other.</p>

<p>A sparkle of animation lit Rose's exhaustion-drawn
face to boyishness.</p>

<p>"I'm not hurt. I want to tell you that if I'd
known who you were, yesterday, I'd never have
asked you to ride with me," he answered, warmly
impulsive.</p>

<p>"You'd have let me walk?"</p>

<p>"I'd have got into the mechanician's seat and
let you <i>drive</i>. Do you suppose I'd have kept the
wheel with you in the car? But what you said
about my driving made it so no one could rattle
me, Mr. Gerard; I am not going out of the race
because of that, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Going out of the race? Why, you're running
in third place!"</p>

<p>Rose shook his head, his mouth set, holding out
two blistered hands and linen-wound arms.</p>

<p>"I've given out," he acknowledged bitterly.
"There'll be no finish for my car. I can't hold
my wheel without an hour to rest and get these
into shape. Kid amateur, all right."</p>

<p>"Where's your alternate driver?"</p>

<p>"He slipped on a greasy bit of grass, ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
minutes ago, and sprained his ankle. We're out of
it, with third place ours and a perfect car to run."</p>

<p>Gerard looked down the row of illuminated
tents to where the pink car stood, palpitating in
an aura of its own light, and brought his eyes
back to the other man.</p>

<p>"My machine went out of the race, two hours
ago, with a broken crankshaft. If you like, I'll
be your alternate," he offered.</p>

<p>Incredulous, breathless, Rose stared at him.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will drive your car until you are ready
to take it again for the finish. I've nothing else
to do, to-night."</p>

<p>It was a time and a scene where over-tense
nerves not infrequently snapped. But if Gerard
was not surprised to see it, Rose certainly was
both amazed and humiliated to feel his own eyes
suddenly stinging like a girl's.</p>

<p>"If ever I can do anything for you," he stammered
fervently.</p>

<p>"I'll give you the chance," promised Gerard,
tactfully gay. "Now hurry up your men with
the car while I find my mechanician."</p>

<p>The comrade aid had been given to Rose, without
the least relation to Rose's sister. But nevertheless
Gerard directed a curious look toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
teeming grand-stand, as he turned to make ready.
Was she there, he wondered, the flower-like girl
with the name of a flower, who had rested in his
arms just so long as a blossom might flutter
against one in passing? Would her gaze follow
the pink racer, still?</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>II</h2>
<h3>CORRIE AND HIS OTHER FELLOW</h3>

<p>The touring car rolled slowly through the
October leaves rustling and swirling down the
road in jovial wind-eddies, came up to a knoll
beside the field, and stopped. The driver turned
in his seat to face the two occupants of the
tonneau, pushing his goggles up above the line
of his fair hair.</p>

<p>"Look," he urged eagerly. "Look at the
pitcher of our home team. There, just crossing
the diamond&mdash;it's a new inning."</p>

<p>"It's not the first baseball game you've brought
us out to see, Corrie," observed Mr. Thomas
Rose, setting his own goggles on his cap above
the line of his reddish-gray hair. "Is it, my
girl?"</p>

<p>His daughter laughed, shaking her small head
in its crimson hood and glancing roguishly at her
brother.</p>

<p>"Nor the twenty-first, papa," she amplified.</p>

<p>"Well, but I haven't brought you to see the
game, but the pitcher," the boy protested. "He's
a new one; you never saw him before. Look."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I want you to."</p>

<p>Flavia Rose obediently turned her gaze toward
the players, and upon the indicated man it halted,
arrested.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed under her breath, and
sat still.</p>

<p>The men were in their places, alert in poised
expectation, the attention of the whole field concentrating
upon the central figure of the pitcher
at whom the young girl also looked. A slim,
straight statue he stood during a full moment,
then slowly raised his arms above his head in a
gesture of supple grace and ease. The afternoon
sun struck across his wind-ruffled brown hair and
smiling face, as he gave a brief nod to the catcher
and dropped his arm with a lithe, swift movement
and turn of his whole body. The white ball shot
across, swerving almost at the plate, and crashed
into the catcher's mitt.</p>

<p>"He's got speed!" Mr. Rose approved loudly,
standing up in the car. "That's pitching! Who's
your friend, Corwin B.?"</p>

<p>His son did not answer. The ball was back in
the pitcher's hands; again he was lifting his arms
in the pose his physical beauty made classic.
There was repeated the quick nod, the abruptly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
swift movement, and the ball sped across, dropping
oddly.</p>

<p>"Strike two!" was called.</p>

<p>Amid the applause and shouts of encouragement,
Flavia laid her small, urgent hand on her
brother's sleeve.</p>

<p>"Corrie, who is he? Tell us, please."</p>

<p>He moved to see her more directly.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the Beach twenty-four-hour
race, last summer, where I finished third? Do you
remember how I told you about the big driver,
Allan Gerard, who drove my machine for two
hours until I could hold the wheel again myself?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Strike three&mdash;you're out!" rang the umpire's
announcement; again the joyous shouts interrupted
speech.</p>

<p>"Well, then, that's who."</p>

<p>"That's Gerard, playing ball?" interrogated
Mr. Rose, incredulous. "What for? Lost his
racing job?"</p>

<p>Laughing, Corrie shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, sir! Gerard is a member of the Mercury
automobile company and has their western factory
and all that end of the business in his hands. He
races the Mercury car because he loves the work
and because no one else can do it so well. No;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
practice for the Cup race opens to-morrow, and
he's here on Long Island for that. But the pitcher
of our home team put his arm out of business
yesterday, and Gerard offered to pitch for this
game. He knows everybody here&mdash;he always
knows everybody everywhere, he's that kind. And
I want to ask him to dinner," he concluded
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose scanned the field for a flying ball, as
a sharp crack announced the first hit.</p>

<p>"Staying out here, or going in to the city each
day?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"He's staying in Jamaica, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you'd best ask him to stop at your house
until the race comes off, or he'll wreck his machine
from weakness brought on by starvation," pronounced
Mr. Rose, dryly. "One dinner won't
carry him through weeks. I know those hotels,
myself."</p>

<p>Corrie gasped, his face swept by delighted awe.</p>

<p>"Really? Oh, I'd give anything to have
Gerard, <i>Gerard</i>, like that! Do you think he'll
come?"</p>

<p>"If he had dinner at his hotel last night, and
breakfast and lunch to-day, he'll come," his father
assured. "Now be quiet and let me watch the
game; it must be near ending."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Almost, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the <i>but</i>, Corwin B. Keep cool."</p>

<p>But Corrie could not keep cool. When his
father's attention was engaged he slipped down
from his seat and went around to Flavia's side
of the car.</p>

<p>"Do you think he would come?" he asked, for
her ears alone. "Don't you want him, too? Why
are you so serious&mdash;what <i>do</i> you think?"</p>

<p>Their clear violet-blue eyes met in the intimate
household love and understanding of all their lives.
Flavia dropped a caressing arm around her
brother's shoulders, gently drawing him to face
the field.</p>

<p>"Really look," she bade.</p>

<p>Puzzled, he obeyed. Gerard was still occupying
the centre of the diamond, holding the ball aloft
while his meditative gaze apparently dwelt on the
batsman. There was scarcely a perceptible turn
of his brown head, yet as the two in the car
watched, the impromptu pitcher's glance flashed
from behind his uplifted arm and he whirled in a
half-circle to hurl the unexpected ball straight
across the diamond to where a careless enemy had
ventured from second base. Too late the startled
runner saw; the sudden attack won.</p>

<p>"You're out!" pealed the quick decision. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
game was closed. With the gay uproar of local
triumph Mr. Rose mingled his approving applause,
still standing upright in the car to view the scene.</p>

<p>"Well, of what are you thinking?" Corrie repeated.
"He's splendid, I know that."</p>

<p>"I am thinking of Isabel," Flavia answered
quietly, "and of you. If you take Mr. Gerard
home, she will see a great deal of him."</p>

<p>Astonished, he regarded her. After a moment
he again looked toward the man opposite, his expression
sober.</p>

<p>"It's like you to think of me," he acknowledged,
with slow gratitude. "But that's all right. If
any one else can get her, I'd better know it now.
Of course he'll want her, she's just the kind of
girl he'd like, such a sport herself about cars and
things. If she likes him better than me, why I'll
have to stand it, that's all."</p>

<p>"Then, I shall be very glad to have Mr. Gerard
stay with us, dear; don't you and I always like
the same things?"</p>

<p>"We sure do, Other Fellow?"</p>

<p>The childhood "play name" brought their
cordial glances together, as Mr. Rose dropped
into his seat.</p>

<p>"Game's over, Corwin B.; better run get your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
friend," he notified, cheerily imperious. "Hurry
along."</p>

<p>Half-smiling, half-anxious, Corrie lingered on
the verge of compliance.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I feel a chill at the idea," he avowed. "I
believe, after all, I'm shy of Gerard!"</p>

<p>"Now what's the matter?" Mr. Rose ejaculated,
staring after his son. "Shy; and I've been trying
ever since he was born&mdash;without succeeding&mdash;to
teach him that there were one or two people
on earth bigger than he is."</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it so, then?"</p>

<p>She laughed with him, mutinously unanswering.</p>

<p>Whatever diffidence Corrie had felt promptly
vanished when Gerard turned from the group of
players and met him. Flushed with vigorous
exercise and recent conquest, his smiling eyes
warming to recognition as they fell upon the
breathless young motorist, there certainly was
nothing intimidating in the late pitcher's aspect.</p>

<p>"I'm Corrie Rose&mdash;you haven't forgotten?
Come meet my father and sister, won't you?" was
Corrie's eager greeting.</p>

<p>It was not at all the dignified self-introduction
and invitation he had planned as he ran across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the field, but Gerard had the gift of drawing sincerity
to meet his own, like to like.</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten me," countered the
other, giving his hand. "And I should be delighted
to meet your father and Miss Rose, if I
were fit. Perhaps you'll give me another chance."</p>

<p>"Fit? Why, we've been watching you play
ball! A fellow don't play ball in a frock coat.
We want you to come home to dinner, now, and
stay with us over the race. You know I'm practising
for it, too. Don't say no," as Gerard
moved. "We <i>want</i> you."</p>

<p>The impulsive, italicized speech was very compelling.</p>

<p>"Thank you; I'll come over to your car, anyway,"
Gerard accepted. "But&mdash;&mdash;What is
it, Rupert?"</p>

<p>"I guess you'd call it a raincoat," was the
drawled reply. "I'd feel bad to find you'd brought
out your pajamas, for there ain't anything to do
except wear it, now."</p>

<p>"I'm not cold."</p>

<p>The mechanician nodded a brief return to Corrie's
laughing salute, and directed his sardonic
black eyes to Gerard's right arm, which the rolled-back
sleeve left bare to the elbow.</p>

<p>"I ain't specially timid," he submitted. "If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
rheumatism is part of the racing equipment you
like to have with you, I'll just hurry home and
make my will before we start."</p>

<p>With an impatient shrug Gerard slipped into
the garment.</p>

<p>"Thanks; you're worse than a wife. Rose,
you know Jack Rupert, who's sheer nerve when
we're racing and sheer nerves when we're not."</p>

<p>"I surely do," Corrie warmly confirmed. "You
rode with Mr. Gerard at the Beach when he drove
my car for me. I'm not likely to forget <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>The small, malignly intelligent mechanician
contemplated him, unsmiling, although far from
unfriendly.</p>

<p>"I ride with Gerard," he acquiesced.</p>

<p>And only Gerard himself knew the history of
service in the face of death comprehended in the
simple statement.</p>

<p>Thomas Rose, repeatedly millionaire and genially
absolute dictator in his circle of affairs, was
not easy to gainsay. And he chose to assume
prompt possession of Gerard, almost before the
introduction was over.</p>

<p>"Get right in," he commanded. "Never mind
anything, get in; and we'll talk about keeping
you after we've had dinner. We'll stop at your
hotel for your things, if you want them."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're very good," Gerard began, and
stopped, encountering Flavia's eyes. Neither had
spoken of their former meeting, indeed they had
been given no opportunity for speech, yet the acute
recollection was a bond between them.</p>

<p>"We do not wish to be insistent, Mr. Gerard,"
she said now, in her fresh, soft tones. "But we
should be very glad to have you."</p>

<p>Gerard continued to look at her, gravely attentive
as she herself. She was as exquisitely dressed
as when he had caught her in his arms on the
stairs of the Beach grand-stand, the fragile hand
she laid on the car door carried the vivid flash of
jewels. Somehow he divined that her father exacted
this, that in his pride of self-made millionaire
he would insist upon extravagance as other
men might upon economy. And she would yield.
He remembered her playful speech at their first
meeting: "I am the only passive member of a
strong-willed family." His impression was of her
most feminine softness that was not in the least weak.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he answered. "I should have
liked above all things to be your guest. But it
happens that I have brought my mechanician with
me and that I cannot desert him at the hotel. It
does not matter at all about relative social position;
we are down here together. Moreover, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
have a ninety Mercury racing machine to look
after, and I should be a most unrestful visitor, up
at dawn and out until dark."</p>

<p>"If that's all," decided Mr. Rose, "this is a
seven-passenger car and an architect said my
house had ninety-five rooms. There's standing
room in the garage, I guess, for a car or two.
Corrie, turn loose your horn."</p>

<p>Corrie promptly put his finger on the button
of the electric signal, and a raucous wail shattered
the sunset hush.</p>

<p>"That's your man, looking this way? I like
your sticking to him, Gerard. Here he comes.
We're all fixed, then; get in."</p>

<p>Gerard got in, beside Flavia, who laughingly
drew her velvet skirts to give him place.</p>

<p>"I think this bears a perilous resemblance to
a kidnapping," she doubted. "Is it quite safe, I
wonder? Shall you summon rescue when we reach
a populated place?"</p>

<p>"If kidnapping means being taken against one's
will, I haven't any case," he returned as seriously.
"I don't believe I could be dislodged from here,
now, if you tried."</p>

<p>"I had not contemplated the attempt&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Please do not! I look like a tramp, I know,
but I will be exceedingly good."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not immoderately good; we are a frivolous
family," she deprecated.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, and their eyes
laughed together.</p>

<p>Radiant, Corrie was already behind the steering-wheel,
an impatient hand poised to release the
brake.</p>

<p>"Beside me, Rupert," he blithely invited, when
the mechanician came up.</p>

<p>Rupert looked at Gerard, received his gesture
of corroboration, and lifting his cap to Flavia,
took the designated seat without comment.</p>

<p>"Don't you care where you're going?" presently
demanded Corrie, moving up a speed. He
respected Allan Gerard's little mechanician almost
as much as he did Allan Gerard, knowing his reputation
in racing circles; the glance he gave to
accompany the query was an invitation to friendship.</p>

<p>Rupert braced one small tan shoe against the
floor, as the car wrenched itself out of a tenacious
sand rut.</p>

<p>"I ain't worrying," he kindly assured. "Any
place that ain't New York is off the map, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I thought you belonged out west with Mr.
Gerard."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess I belong to the Mercury racer. But
I'm officially chief tester at the eastern factory,
up the Hudson, except when there's a race on.
Since Darling French got married, I've raced with
Gerard. Were you aiming to collect that horseshoe
with a nail in it, ahead there on the course,
or will it be an accident?"</p>

<p>"It's going to be an escape," smiled the driver,
swerving deftly. "Tell me about the first part
of the ball game, won't you? I missed it, going
after my father and sister."</p>

<p>"Who, me? I ain't qualified. The curves I'm
used to judging belong to a different game. I
guess, if you listen to what's being said behind us,
you'll get the better record. I'm enjoying the
novelty of the automobile ride, myself."</p>

<p>"You must be," Corrie agreed ironically.
"You get so little of it. They are not talking
<i>real</i> ball."</p>

<p>But he settled back to listen. In fact, it was
the recent game that was being discussed in the
tonneau, with Mr. Rose as chief speaker and Flavia
as auditor. The party was of enchanting congeniality.</p>

<p>They drove first to the hotel where Gerard had
been stopping.</p>

<p>It was quite six o'clock when the touring car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
rolled through Mr. Rose's lawns and landscape-garden
scenery, to come to a stop before the large,
pink stone house of many columns. Mr. Rose had
a passion for columns. Across the rug-strewn
veranda a girl advanced to meet the arriving
motorists; an auburn-haired, high-colored girl
who wore a tweed ulster over her light evening
gown.</p>

<p>"I thought you were never coming," she reproached,
imperiously aggrieved. "I hate waiting.
And I want uncle to send Lenoir after my
runabout&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence broke as she saw the man beside
Flavia, her gray eyes widened in astonished interest.</p>

<p>"My niece Isabel Rose, Mr. Gerard," presented
Mr. Rose. "And now you have met all of us.
Come on, Corwin B."</p>

<p>Isabel Rose gave her hand to the guest. She
had the slightly hard beauty of nineteen years
and exuberant health; contrasted with Flavia,
there was almost a boyishness in her air of assurance
and athletic vigor. But in the studied coquetry
of her glance at Gerard, the instant desire
to allure in response to the allure of this man's
good looks, she showed femininity of a type that
her cousin never would understand.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should not have minded waiting," she declared,
in her high-pitched, clear-cut speech, "if
I had known something pleasant was going to
happen."</p>

<p>"If that means me, Miss Rose&mdash;&mdash;" Gerard
laughingly doubted.</p>

<p>"I don't see anyone else who happens; the rest
of them are just always here," she confirmed,
shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>He regarded her with the gay indulgence one
shows an agreeable child. "Then, all thanks for
the welcome. I shall try to live up to it, if you
will not expect too much."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I shall!"</p>

<p>"Then perhaps I had better retreat at once?"</p>

<p>"You might try, first. Don't you think so,
Flavia?"</p>

<p>"I think we might go in," Flavia smilingly
suggested from the threshold. "We could assume
Mr. Gerard's safety so far."</p>

<p>"Come on, Corwin B.," his father summoned
again.</p>

<p>But Corrie sat still in his place, leaning on his
steering-wheel and gazing curiously at his cousin
and Gerard. Nor did he follow the group into
the house; instead, he took the car and Jack
Rupert around to the garage.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later, when Flavia Rose went upstairs
to make ready for dinner, Isabel followed her,
frankly inquisitive.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Gerard the real Gerard, the Gerard
who races cars?" the examination commenced, as
soon as the cousins were alone.</p>

<p>"He is Allan Gerard," Flavia stated. "Did
you have a nice game, this afternoon?"</p>

<p>The distraction was put aside.</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty fair. I walked home across the
links and left the runabout at the club. Did you
ever meet Mr. Gerard before? You seem to know
each other pretty well."</p>

<p>Flavia's delicate color flushed over her face; for
an instant she again felt Gerard's firm arm around
her and encountered his concerned eyes bent upon
her own, as they stood on the stairs of the grand-stand.
Truthfulness was the atmosphere of the
household, the truthfulness born of fearless affection
and cordial sympathy of feeling, but now
she used an evasion, almost for the first time in
her life.</p>

<p>"It is Corrie who knows Mr. Gerard, Isabel,"
she explained, a trifle slowly. "You remember
that race when he helped Corrie, last summer?
To-day Corrie saw him playing ball, and brought
him to meet us."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Yes, I remember the race, of course;
I was there. But I did not know Allan Gerard
was&mdash;well, <i>looked</i> like that. How long will he
be here?"</p>

<p>"Papa and Corrie asked him to stay until the
Cup race is over."</p>

<p>There was a pause. Isabel walked over to one
of the long mirrors and studied her own vigorously
handsome image, then turned her head and
regarded Flavia with the perfect complacency and
mischievous malice of a young kitten.</p>

<p>"Good sport," she anticipated.</p>

<p>Flavia carefully laid her brush upon the
dressing table and proceeded to gather into a coil
the shimmering mass of her fair hair. Suddenly
she was afraid, quiveringly afraid of herself, of
Gerard and the next two weeks, but most afraid
of showing any change in expression to Isabel's
sharp scrutiny.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>III</h2>
<h3>THE HOUSEHOLD OF ROSES</h3>

<p>"If there is one thing meaner than another,
it's <i>rain</i>," Corrie announced generally. "I'm
going out. Won't you come, Gerard?"</p>

<p>"If rain is the meanest thing there is, it shows
real sense to go out in it," Isabel commented,
from the window-seat opposite. "That is just
like you, Corrie Rose. When I ask you to take me
out on a perfectly fair day, you won't do it."</p>

<p>"I?" stunned. "I ever refused&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yesterday, when I asked you to take
me just once around the race course, while the
cars were out practising. You know you would
not. If it is safe for you, it is safe for me. But
never mind; your old pink car won't win, anyhow.
He hasn't a chance with the professional drivers,
has he, Mr. Gerard?"</p>

<p>"A chance?" Gerard gravely echoed. "Why,
several of our best drivers are thinking of withdrawing,
since he is entered, because they feel it's
no use trying to win if he is racing."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're making fun! But I mean it; <i>I</i>
could race that car he is so vain of, with my own
little runabout machine."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Corrie dragged a mandolin from beneath his
chair and tinkled the opening chords of a popular
melody.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">    "Get on your little girl's racer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">    And I'll lead you for a chaser,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">    Down the good old Long Island course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">    And before you're half through it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">    Your poor car will rue it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">    And you'll trade in the pieces for a horse."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The provoking improvisation ended abruptly, as
Isabel's well-aimed sofa-pillow struck the singer.</p>

<p>"Do you call that a ladylike retort?" Corrie
queried, freeing himself from the silken missile.
"Tell her it isn't, Flavia."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," Flavia excused herself. "There
are more cushions on that window-seat."</p>

<p>"It was a soft answer, at least," Gerard
laughed. "And a good shot."</p>

<p>"Oh, I taught her to pitch, myself. Now I'm
sorry," deplored her cousin.</p>

<p>"Too late," Isabel returned complacently. "I
called that a cushion carom, Corrie. And my car
would not fall to pieces. Flavia, he is feeding
candy to Firdousi."</p>

<p>Flavia looked over with the warm brightening
of expression Allan Gerard had learned to watch
for when she regarded her brother, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
never failed to stir in him the half-wistful envy
of the first day when he had seen her so gazing
at the driver of the pink racing car.</p>

<p>"If Corrie can teach a Persian kitten to eat
candy, he probably can teach it to digest candy,"
she offered serene reply. "Besides, he loves
Firdousi, as much as I do."</p>

<p>"I only gave him some fruit-paste to see his
jaws work," the culprit defended. "He needs exercise.
And so do I."</p>

<p>"Not that kind, yours work all the time. It
is only an hour since breakfast and you have
talked ever since," corrected his cousin.</p>

<p>"I haven't!"</p>

<p>"You have."</p>

<p>Corrie ran his fingers through his heavy fair
hair, carefully set the purring kitten on the floor,
and stood up.</p>

<p>"All right, if you say so," he submitted gracefully.
"What you say, I stand for."</p>

<p>The argument was pure sport, of course. But
with that last playful sentence, Corrie suddenly
turned his dark-blue eyes upon Isabel with an
expression not playful, as if himself struck by
some deeper force in the words.</p>

<p>"What you say, I stand for," he repeated, and
paused.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Flavia and Gerard both looked at him. All the
fresh ardor of first love, all the impulsive faith
of eighteen and its entire devotion invested Corrie
Rose and illumined the shining regard in which
he enveloped his cousin. There was in him a
quality that lifted the moment above mere sentimentality,
a young strength and straightforward
earnestness at once dignified and pathetic with the
pathos of all transient things that must go down
before the battery of the years.</p>

<p>It would have been difficult to encounter a more
enchanting family life than that into which Allan
Gerard had been drawn. The Rose household was
as redolent of simple fragrance as a household of
roses, in spite of its costly luxury, its retinue of
servants and lavish expenditure. Thomas Rose's
wealth had been made so long since, before the
birth of the younger generation, that to one and
all it was merely the natural condition of affairs,
not in the least affecting them personally. Money
was very nearly non-existent to them, since they
never were obliged to consider its lack or abundance.
They spent as they desired, precisely as
they ate when hungry or drank according to thirst,
without either stint or excess. It was Arcadian,
it was improbable, but it was so. And the guard-wall
that encircled their gilded Arcadia was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
strong mutual affection not to be overthrown from
without. Only by internal treason could that domain
fall.</p>

<p>It was not in one day that Gerard had come to
understand this in its fullness; he had learned
bit by bit. For there was nothing at all angelic
about the gay family. But now he first realized,
as he watched Corrie, that Isabel Rose was placed
here by circumstance and not by fittedness. She
was too earthen a vessel, however handsome and
wholesome, to contain that fine sun-shot essence
distilled from the fountain of youth which her
cousin poured out for her taking. Gerard knew
it, as he saw her matter-of-fact acceptance of the
gaze that should have moved even a woman who
did not love Corrie.</p>

<p>Yet, they would probably marry one another,
he reflected. There was nothing to interfere, if
she consented. He felt an elder brother's outrush
of impatient protection for the boy; involuntarily
he turned to Flavia with a movement of
regretful irritation at the folly of it all, a folly
he divined that she also recognized.</p>

<p>Flavia met his glance, and read its impatience
and regret. How she applied it was a reflection
less of her own mind than of Isabel's; she fancied
Gerard jealous of this open wooing of the other
girl, and mutely asking her own intervention.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>That intervention was not easy to give. In
spite of herself, the days with Allan Gerard had
affected her so far. Stooping, she lifted Firdousi
to her lap, gaining a moment before breaking the
silence that had fallen upon the group.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take Mr. Gerard,
Corrie?" she inquired. "Are not the possibilities
storm-limited?"</p>

<p>"He isn't going to take him anywhere," Isabel
calmly interpolated. "They are going to stay in
and amuse us. At least, that is what I say, if he
is going to stand for it. He said he would, but
it's some large order."</p>

<p>Corrie threw back his head, all seriousness
vanishing before his laughter.</p>

<p>"Just you let father catch you slinging Boweryese
like that, Miss Rose," he begged, moving
aside to stuff a handful of candy into either coat-pocket.
"He loves to hear girls talk slang. But
it <i>is</i> some classy order, all right, if you come to
think of it; I guess I won't commence to-day. I'm
going over to show the <i>Dear Me</i> to Jack Rupert,
Flavia; he thinks he can tell me why her engine
misses."</p>

<p>"In the rain, dear?" his sister wondered.</p>

<p>"'Snips and snails and gasoline tales, are
what little boys are made of,'" Isabel quoted derisive
<i>Mother Goose</i>. "He won't melt; let him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
go. Mr. Gerard, you do not want to go out in a
sloppy motor boat, do you?"</p>

<p>"If you will forgive my bad taste, I believe I
shall go with Corrie," Gerard deprecated, rising.
He looked again at Flavia, but she offered no suggestion
that he stay.</p>

<p>"That's the idea," approved the gentleman in
question. "I'll ring for our raincoats."</p>

<p>There was a period of silence in the many-windowed,
octagonal library, after the two young
girls were left alone. Flavia continued to play
with the drowsy kitten. Isabel, chin in hand, gazed
across the rain-drenched window-panes, her full
lips bent discontentedly. The first diversion was
effected by the smart slap of a maple-leaf flattened
against the glass by a gust of wind, directly across
the watcher's line of vision.</p>

<p>"P.P.C.," interpreted Flavia, surveying the
large pale-golden leaf, as it adhered to the wet
pane opposite her cousin.</p>

<p>"Now, what may that mean?" Isabel demanded.</p>

<p>"<i>Pour prendre cong&eacute;</i>, of course. Those are
the farewell cards of departing summer. See her
coat-of-arms on it: a gold-and-crimson sunset?"</p>

<p>Isabel eyed her companion with scornful superiority.</p>

<p>"You had better talk sense," she counselled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
"That is a good stiff north wind blowing, and
Corrie is just as reckless with his motor boat as
he is with his car. He and Mr. Gerard are likely
to be half-drowned&mdash;and I am glad of it."</p>

<p>"Isa!"</p>

<p>"I am glad. It serves them right for leaving
me at home and going off with that mechanic. I
know why Corrie did it, too; he didn't want us to
be together all day. He is jealous of Mr. Gerard
because he likes me."</p>

<p>"Corrie does?"</p>

<p>Isabel launched a glance of malicious comprehension
over her shoulder, smilingly meaningly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Corrie! Of course! But I meant Mr.
Gerard. Anyone can see how Corrie hates to have
him with me."</p>

<p>Flavia adjusted the blue-satin bow upon
Firdousi's neck, saying nothing for a moment.
She did not intend to put the question hovering
at her lips, yet suddenly the indiscreet words
escaped her:</p>

<p>"Then, you think Mr. Gerard is&mdash;interested
in you?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever know a man to come here without
being interested in me, Flavia Rose?"</p>

<p>The superb arrogance was a trifle too much to
escape retort, even from the considerate Flavia.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, there was Mr. Stone," she recalled, with
intention.</p>

<p>Isabel colored richly, her handsome light-gray
eyes hardened. The recent episode of Mr. Ethan
Stone had not been one of her triumphs in flirtation.</p>

<p>"He was almost as old as uncle," she exclaimed
sharply. "He would have died of fright at the
things Mr. Gerard and Corrie and I like to do,
anyway, if he had stayed here. He was all nerves.
So are you, for that matter. You are worried
over Corrie now, you know you are."</p>

<p>Flavia never quarrelled; she had an abhorrence
of scenes. But that did not imply a lack of
capacity for anger. She rose, a straight, slim
figure in her blue morning-frock, the kitten in her
arms.</p>

<p>"If I were with him, I should not be worried,"
she stated with dignity. "I am never afraid when
I am there to share what happens. I think I will
go upstairs."</p>

<p>And she went, leaving the other girl to devise
her own amusements.</p>

<p>In her own room, Flavia pushed aside the window-curtains
to look out. In all the dripping
landscape she saw no trace of her brother or their
guest; the guest, half of whose visit was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
past. The next day would be Sunday; one of the
two weeks she had unreasoningly dreaded was
gone, already. Was she glad, or sorry? She
did not know. But she continued to look from
the window; there was indeed a strong north wind
blowing, and Corrie, if not reckless, certainly used
the least margin of safety.</p>

<p>It was impossible to be more safe from drowning
than Corrie was at that time. He was in fact
on land as dry as the weather permitted, engaged
in operating a small ciderpress for the benefit of
himself and Gerard, at a certain old-fashioned
farm where he was&mdash;as he himself explained&mdash;persona
very grata indeed.</p>

<p>"They are used to me," he supplemented.
"Wonderful what people can get used to, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It surely is," Gerard agreed, from his seat
on an overturned barrel. He contemplated interestedly
the picture Corrie presented with his
sleeves rolled to the elbow, his coat off and his
bright hair flecked with ruby-hued drops of the
flying liquid. "See here, Corrie, what are you
planning to do with yourself?"</p>

<p>"Do? Meet Rupert and try out the <i>Dear Me</i>,
of course. Why?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that way. College? Business?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! Would you pitch over that tin-cup,
please? Why, I am all through college."</p>

<p>"Through it! Before you are nineteen?"</p>

<p>"Jes' so. Like to see the pretty blue-ribboned
papers that prove it?" He sat down on the
press, drying his face with his handkerchief. "You
see, my father had tutors to lavish all their wisdom
and attention on little Corwin B. Rose, and I
never had to wait while the rest of a class ploughed
along, so I got through the usual junk and was
ready for college at fifteen plus. So I entered
at New York, where I could drive back and forth
from home each day, and finished up the college
business. It was a nuisance and I wanted to get
it over, so I hustled a bit. The classical course,
you know, not the professional. I graduated last
Spring, just before I met you at the twenty-four-hour
race. You look surprised."</p>

<p>"I should not have thought it of you."</p>

<p>"You didn't suppose I could work?" The
mischievous blue eyes laughed at him. "I can,
when I have to. And studying doesn't hit me
very hard, although I'd rather be out-doors."</p>

<p>"Not that, exactly. You do not look it,"
Gerard said slowly. He could not explain the
effects he had seen left by college life with unlimited
money at command, or how he was moved
by their utter absence here.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Corrie gave way to open mirth.</p>

<p>"What a compliment! My word! Fancy!
Well, I can't help my face. Anyway, you think
I look as if I could drive a car, so I'm satisfied.
Do you know," his expression sobered as he leaned
forward, fixing earnest eyes on his companion's,
"I would rather be you, do what you are doing,
than be or do anything else in the world. Of
course, I shan't get the chance&mdash;probably I
couldn't do the work if I did&mdash;but I should <i>love</i>
it."</p>

<p>Gerard actually colored before that ardent admiration,
taken unaware.</p>

<p>"Corrie Rose, you are given to the folly of
hero-worship; and heroes are few," he accused
sternly.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Mr. Gerard."</p>

<p>"I do. But, Corrie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Present."</p>

<p>Gerard stood up, reaching for his raincoat.</p>

<p>"Beware of heroine-worship, it is <i>the</i> folly.
When you find the real woman, get on your knees,
where you belong, before a grace of God, but don't
build shrines to an imitation."</p>

<p>Astonished, Corrie paused, upright beside the
ciderpress, then smiled with a blending of pride
and serious exaltation.</p>

<p>"No danger of that! I&mdash;that can never hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>pen
to me," he assured quietly. "I am safe-guarded
from imitations, win or lose. I believe,
if I am given to hero-worship, that I'm pretty
good at picking the right subjects for it. Had
enough cider?"</p>

<p>"Too much, probably. If I am ill to-morrow,
I shall tell Rupert that you poisoned me. Are
you going around to pay the lord proprietors of
the place for what we have consumed?"</p>

<p>"Who, me? If I did, Mrs. Goodwin might
box my ears for the impertinence; she has boxed
them before. I grew up around here, remember.
The first acquaintance I made with this house was
when I shied an apple at the family tabby as it
sat sunning itself on the well-curb, and bowled it
in. Naturally, I hadn't meant to hit it; the
beast stepped forward just as I fired. I nearly
fell in, myself, trying to get it out, but the well
was deep and I couldn't raise a meow or a whisker.
It was a fine November Sunday, I remember, and
while I was busy the family drove into the yard,
home from church. I bolted. No one saw me go,
but by and by I began to remember all the yarns
I ever had heard about people getting typhoid
fever from polluted well-water, and to imagine
that entire household dying on my hands. Remorse
with a capital R! I felt like Cesare Borgia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and Madame de Brinvilliers and the Veiled
Mokanna all rolled into one. When I couldn't
stand it any longer, I sneaked into Flavia's room
at two o'clock in the morning, for counsel."</p>

<p>"She gave it?"</p>

<p>"She gave it. You can always count on Flavia.
I can see her now, sitting up in bed with her
hair braided in two big yellow plaits and her
troubled kiddie countenance turned to me.</p>

<p>"'You will have to tell either papa or those
people,' she decided, wise as a toy owl. 'And
if you tell them, <i>they</i> will surely tell papa, so perhaps
you would rather tell him yourself. But I
am sorry, dear darling.'</p>

<p>"So I 'fessed up, after breakfast."</p>

<p>"What happened?" Gerard questioned.</p>

<p>"We drove over to the farm together, and
father went in for a private interview with old
man Goodwin. After which he, father, escorted
me around to the well and informed me that I was
to drink a cup of that water. Phew, I would
rather have drunk hemlock! I wasn't much given
to begging off when I got into trouble, but I tried
that time, all right.</p>

<p>"'It's what you've left these folks to drink,'
said he, standing with his hands in his pockets,
looking at me. 'It would have been a lot more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
pleasant for you to swallow if you had owned up
two days ago; just keep that as a reminder never
to put off a thing you ought to do. Take your
medicine, Corwin B.'</p>

<p>"I took it. But it almost killed me." He shook
his blond head disgustedly. "I told him I would
probably die of typhoid, or something worse. He
said we would chance it."</p>

<p>"Still, it was a chance, Corrie."</p>

<p>Corrie calmly fastened the last button of his
raincoat.</p>

<p>"No, I guess not. You see, old Goodwin had
told father that they pulled pussy out of the well
ten minutes after I ran away, the first day. She
was clinging to the bucket, pretty wet, but healthy
and merry. Father told me the truth, before dinner-time;
I didn't seem to care for luncheon, that
day. Have you got a pencil? I've lost my fountain-pen
again; that's the third I've bought this
month."</p>

<p>Gerard produced the pencil.</p>

<p>"It was a rough joke on you, though," he commented.
"Didn't you resent it?"</p>

<p>Corrie lifted his bright clear glance from his
task of tearing a blank leaf from his notebook.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I earned it?" he asked. "Keep the
lines straight, Gerard; my father never punished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
me in anger, nor unless I could first admit I deserved
it and we could shake hands on it afterward.
Of course, that sort of thing ended five
years ago&mdash;there never was much of it&mdash;but there
couldn't be closer friends than we have been, right
through. We have kept each other's respect, we
couldn't get along without it; and we expect a
good deal of each other, too. I just don't want
you to misunderstand."</p>

<p>He scribbled his signature across the bit of
paper, and secured the legend to the ciderpress.</p>

<p>"There; now the Goodwins will know who has
been here. Ready?"</p>

<p>"Ready," Gerard assented.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased; the vigorous broom of the
north wind was sweeping the broken storm-clouds
across a gray sky. The drive to the yacht club
was accomplished pleasantly and quickly.</p>

<p>"I told Rupert to meet us here at noon," Corrie
observed, when they stopped at the pier. "And
I had lunch for three sent over, this morning.
What a deserted old hole the club is in October!
Hello, what&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>From beneath the tarpaulin cover of a long,
polished motor boat moored in the wall-locked
artificial harbor, a frowsy head had projected, to
be instantly withdrawn into shelter at sight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
two young men. The genus of that head was
unmistakable, the action significant. Both arrivals
halted involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Club steward?" inquired Gerard, with irony.</p>

<p>"Tramp!" flared his companion, recovering
breath after the first shock of amazement at the
audacity of the intruder. "A dirty, lazy hobo
in my boat! Lying on my cushions, mauling my
things, running my engine for all I know. Oh!"</p>

<p>"Hold on," Gerard advised. "Better investigate."</p>

<p>But Corrie was already at the edge of the pier.</p>

<p>"Come out of there!" he shouted imperiously.
"Come out, I say, or I'll come aboard and throw
you out. What do you mean by it? Come out, I
tell you."</p>

<p>The head slowly emerged, a red head in need of
combing; its owner rested his arms on the gleaming
mahogany deck and turned a sullen, unshaven
face on his challenger.</p>

<p>"Stand me a quarter, an' I'll beat it," he invited
raucously.</p>

<p>"A quarter! You'll beat it without a cent and
do it quick, or go to jail. That is my boat, do
you hear? Come out. What are you doing there?
Stealing?"</p>

<p>"Sleepin', if you want to know."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got a right to know. Are you going to
take your filthy self off my cushions, or am I
going to throw you off?"</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>me</i>. Who do you think?"</p>

<p>The man measured his young antagonist with
unhurried scrutiny, yawned, and ostentatiously
settled himself in a position of greater comfort.</p>

<p>"You can't do it," he sneered. "Send a man."</p>

<p>The <i>Dear Me</i> was not anchored, but moored to
the pier by a pulley and tackle. Before the
diverted Gerard guessed his purpose, Corrie had
hauled in the boat's bow by the running line
attached and swung himself raging into the craft
below. There was a choked oath, a sound of rending
canvas, then the clatter and thud of combat
in close quarters.</p>

<p>It was over before Gerard could do more than
haul the reeling, water-drenched boat again within
reach. A great splash, a cry changing to a
smothered gurgle, announced a threat fulfilled.</p>

<p>"I don't want any help," panted Corrie, standing
erect and dishevelled, fiery blue eyes on his
floundering enemy. "He's had enough, I fancy.
Here, the water is only five feet deep, you chump!
Not that way! Throw me an oar, Gerard&mdash;he'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
drown himself in a saucer. Here, catch hold, you.
What's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"You pitched him into pretty cold water,"
Gerard reproached, between amusement and pity.
"Got him? Look out! You'll capsize!"</p>

<p>Corrie had him, by the collar, and brought him
to the pier, a streaming, shivering wreck.</p>

<p>"Man's size, am I?" demanded the victor.
"Here, what are you shaking like that for?
You'll kill yourself, man."</p>

<p>The captive looked at him, speechless, shuddering
miserably in the boisterous rush of wind that
wrapped his wet garments about him like a sheath
of ice.</p>

<p>"You silly idiot," Corrie snapped impatiently.
"Why didn't you do as I told you? Open the
basement door, won't you, Gerard, while I bring
him? We'll be sure to find a fire there. Are you
going to come quietly, yes?"</p>

<p>The victim followed tamely to the lower part
of the building, where Corrie threw open a furnace-door
and installed him in the red glow of heat.</p>

<p>"Take off your clothes," he commanded. "Trying
to get pneumonia, are you, so I will feel like a
brute? Oh, I'll give you something to wear; I've
got a lot of old duds in my locker here. What are
you laughing at, Allan Gerard?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"The responsible man's burden. Never mind
me, go on with your rescue."</p>

<p>"I should like to throw something at you."</p>

<p>"Haven't you got enough on your hands?"</p>

<p>The raillery struck some note in the man's pride.
He looked from Gerard to Corrie, who was bringing
an armful of assorted clothing, with a reawakening
defiance not so much evil as primitive.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have put it over me so easy,"
he announced sombrely, "if I'd had the feed I
bet you got this morning."</p>

<p>The garments escaped Corrie's grasp.</p>

<p>"Feed? You're hungry?"</p>

<p>"What you think I was sleepin' in your dinky
boat for, if I had the price of anythin'? It had
a blanket in it an' was better than the open, that's
why."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so," Corrie stormed at
him hotly. "Get into those clothes and come
upstairs. Or, no; I'll bring it down, stay there."</p>

<p>It was an elaborate lunch-hamper that presently
was brought in and set down.</p>

<p>"Eat it," was the concise direction. "That
vacuum-bottle is full of hot coffee; drink it. For
Heaven's sake stop shivering&mdash;<i>why</i> couldn't you
speak? Rupert is coming, Gerard. I heard the
motor-horn down the road."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerard discreetly had turned his back to the
scene, reading a last-season bulletin of yacht racing
that was fixed to the wall at the end of the
room.</p>

<p>"You want to start?" he interpreted, as Corrie
joined him.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I hope you won't mind, but I don't see
how we can. I have got to stay here until that
chattering, shaking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Brimstone pig,'" supplied Gerard, with a
recollection of the unforgettable <i>Mrs. Smallweed</i>.</p>

<p>"Thanks. Until he finishes and can leave, for
the steward will put him out if he finds him here
alone."</p>

<p>"That cannot be long."</p>

<p>"No, but," he hesitated, engagingly confused.
"But we are miles from a restaurant, you know,
and I had to feed him somehow, and there wasn't
anything except our luncheon that I had sent
over for the trip. So I suppose we had better
drive home and get some eats there. It is a shabby
way to treat you, all right, after bringing you
out."</p>

<p>Gerard dropped his hand on the other's shoulder,
his laughing eyes very kind.</p>

<p>"Corrie Rose, how many times a year do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
throw your offenders overboard, and give them
your own lunch to make up for it?" he challenged.</p>

<p>There was no lack of perception in Corrie; he
recognized both the innuendo and its truth.</p>

<p>"About every day," he confessed. "My temper
slips. Everyone expects it of me, so it's all right.
At least, it has been all right; I guess I've got to
stop."</p>

<p>"Corrie, you did not believe me in earnest?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that." He shook his head as if
to shake off a vexing thought. "I&mdash;it makes me
feel like a brute to think I've been knocking out
a half-starved man and throwing him into that
water because he crawled under an old blanket
in my boat for shelter. Why didn't I question
him decently? I must put on the brake, or I'll
spoil something without intending it."</p>

<p>Gerard opened his lips to deny the danger and
recall the provocation received, but for some reason
he did not analyze, closed them without speaking.
The two stood together in silence for many moments,
looking out at the gray-green expanse of
tumbling water.</p>

<p>"I'll be goin'," the hoarse voice of the involuntary
guest said, behind them. "Obliged for your
feed."</p>

<p>There was a tentative quality in the statement,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
an attempt to carry off easily a situation capable
of unpleasant developments, a studied ignoring
of his captor's possible right to detain him. But
Corrie swung around with a face of open sunniness
that shamed suspicion, his hands in the pockets
of his long overcoat.</p>

<p>"Good enough! Did you find what you liked,
or rather, like what you found?" he responded.</p>

<p>The hard face relaxed into a reluctant humor,
the man looked again to assure himself of the
inquirer's seriousness.</p>

<p>"The best ever," he essayed social graciousness.
"I ain't left much. Your little caramels
were fine."</p>

<p>"Caramels? Who on earth put in caramels?
Armand must have lost his mind! What kind
of caramels?"</p>

<p>"Wrapped in tin paper, they were, in a little
tin box."</p>

<p>"Wrapped&mdash;&mdash;Holy cats, Gerard, he has
eaten the concentrated bouillon squares! They
were not to eat, man; they were to be dissolved
in a cup of boiling water, to drink."</p>

<p>"They tasted all right. I guess they'll go. I'll
be movin'."</p>

<p>"Go? Well, I hope so; you must have enough
concentrated beef in you to nourish an army. You
are going, you say. Where to?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"The big town."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do when you get
there?"</p>

<p>The man's dissipation-dulled eyes searched the
candid face of the questioner scarcely ten years
his junior, then he looked to Gerard with a confused
and reluctant unease, as he might have
looked had Corrie been a young girl whose innocence
he feared to offend.</p>

<p>"Aw, lots of things," he evaded, with a short,
embarrassed laugh. "You don't want to hear me
talk, mister. I'll get there, now I'm fed up."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to find work for you around
here? I can."</p>

<p>"My jobs are a different kind, mister. I
couldn't stay in yours."</p>

<p>Corrie brought his hand from his pocket.</p>

<p>"All right, as you like. Take this for good
luck and we'll call ourselves even. Square, is it?"</p>

<p>The man took the bill awkwardly, his
embarrassment deepened.</p>

<p>"You're square, sure," he signified.</p>

<p>As his slouching, bulky figure went out the
door opposite, it crossed the small erect form of
Jack Rupert, who entered.</p>

<p>"Us for home," Corrie greeted the arrival. "It
is too bad to have brought you over for nothing,
Rupert, but&mdash;what's the matter?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>The mechanician's countenance was a study in
disgust, as he contemplated one of his polished
tan boots, a high-heeled, ornate affair of the latest
design labelled "smart." Off the race course and
outside of hours, Rupert had one passion: clothes.</p>

<p>"I ain't registering any complaints if the rest
are satisfied," he acidly returned. "But stepping
in a puddle of wringing rags that the town board
of health ought to condemn for making a noisy
demonstration ain't what I look forward to all day
as a treat. As for going home, I'm ready, myself.
The trip we're missing will keep awhile this
weather. The water is mussed bad and the only
time I ever was car-sick was on the boat to
Savannah."</p>

<p>"Did he spoil his pretty shoes?" Corrie teased,
speculatively eyeing the heap of wet, unsavory
clothing. "Never mind, Briggs shall make them
good as new with his Transcendant Tan for Tasteful
Tootsies; you haven't seen that darky of mine
shine boots. I don't know what to do with those
clothes, Gerard, so I think I won't do anything.
Let's go home before we starve. Rupert, don't
you approve of charity?"</p>

<p>"I ain't fitted to say; nobody ever showed me
any. I always got exactly what I worked for,
measure evened off and loose-packed. If I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sneaked into somebody's boat-garage without an
invitation, I wouldn't get a bath and breakfast
and a greenback; I'd get ten dollars or ten days
from the first judge in the stand. And so would
you."</p>

<p>Corrie paused, struck.</p>

<p>"I? Why?"</p>

<p>"You. Why? What's the answer? I don't
know, but I know the type. You keep your score-card
and watch it happen; you'll find you get
just what you enter for. Nothing more <i>and</i> nothing
less."</p>

<p>"'Nothing more <i>and</i> nothing less,'" Corrie repeated,
unconsciously exact. "Well," his dancing
smile flashed out, "we don't want any more than
that, do we? I'll be content with the life I earn."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing, for that's all we'll get,"
was the terse reply. "When some folks start to
kick a brick wall, luck drops a feather pillow between.
Other people stub their toes. I ain't crying
bad luck, because I never had any; I'm just
saying we'll stub our toes, if we kick the wall. We
don't have to kick it."</p>

<p>"Rupert is a philosopher," Gerard observed,
not mockingly or in ridicule, but as one stating
a fact.</p>

<p>His mechanician nodded coolly.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Calling names don't count. I've raced long
enough to know a type of car when I see it, and
I've lived long enough to tell a type of man. The
way their heads set does it, maybe. Did you know
the ladies were upstairs?"</p>

<p>"The ladies?" echoed Gerard, surprised.
"They came with you?"</p>

<p>"Not precisely, I guess I came with them. Miss
Rose saw me starting and said she was coming
over with her own little machine to see the launch
off, if she could get her cousin to come, and they'd
bring me. So she drove me over. I ain't used
to that."</p>

<p>"Ladies?"</p>

<p>"Ladies' driving. My life's insured, so it was
all right, though."</p>

<p>"Bully for Isabel!" Corrie approved, pensiveness
cast aside. "Come up to them, Gerard. I
hear her tooting for us with the horn."</p>

<p>From the little scarlet runabout&mdash;the largest
motor vehicle Mr. Rose would allow his vigorous
niece&mdash;Isabel and Flavia had descended.</p>

<p>"We came to see what you were doing," Isabel
welcomed the group who issued from the club-house.
"I don't suppose Flavia would have come
if she hadn't been wondering whether Corrie was
drowning himself. Go ahead and start; don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
wait on our account. But you had better eat your
lunch first, if you haven't already, for you will
have no time to eat in the boat on that sea."</p>

<p>"We haven't any lunch," Corrie cheerfully declared.
"I gave it to a tramp after I threw him
overboard. You're just in time to take us home
for luncheon and save our lives."</p>

<p>"You look as if you had been fighting," Isabel
criticized, with a scornful survey of his attire.
"You are all splashed with dirty water, your
cravat is pulled crooked and your coat is torn.
We saw your tramp; he passed us a few moments
ago and we recognized your blue flannel suit with
the <i>Dear Me's</i> insignia on the lapel. Mr. Rupert
guessed what you had been doing, when he saw the
boat all in disorder and the pier all wet. The
man's hairy, dirty face looked horrid above your
clothes."</p>

<p>"A contrast to my beauty, not so? Fix my
cravat, please, ma'am; I can't see the thing.
But his face wasn't dirty, for I washed it."</p>

<p>"Why should I fix your wet cravat? Hold my
gloves, then. Where is your scarf-pin? Stolen
by your tramp, I suppose."</p>

<p>Gerard had joined Flavia, but neither yet had
spoken, watching the cousins. They had not the
fluent familiarity of intercourse possessed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
two who looked and acted very like a pair of
handsome boys. Moreover, Gerard distrusted himself,
fearing to say too much, too soon. He was
approaching Flavia carefully and delicately as a
man striving to close his hand on some frail,
elusive creature whose capture he scarcely dares
hope possible. And she gave him no help. Her
frank gentleness and impersonal cordiality gave
neither encouragement nor discouragement, no
foothold smooth or rough.</p>

<p>The actual position he had never even conceived;
the fact that she was completely unconscious of
his desire to woo her. He had no way of knowing
that it was his attitude toward Isabel she considered
in all his words and acts, remembering
her cousin's confident appropriation of the guest.
It was of Isabel that she spoke now, while Gerard
hesitated for the right word to offer the girl
beside him.</p>

<p>"The roads were very wet and slippery," she
remarked. "If Isabel were not a good driver, I
think we would have found ourselves in a ditch.
Indeed," her soft mouth dimpled into a smile,
"once I thought we were in one. One wheel <i>was</i>.
But we wiggled out again. Mr. Rupert wanted
to put the chains on the wheels, but she said we
did not need them."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The thought of Isabel over-ruling the judgment
of his racing mechanician unsteadied Gerard's
gravity.</p>

<p>"A coarse masculine hand is needed on the
wheel, to-day," he confirmed, with ulterior intention.
"I believe we had better divide our party
differently, on the way back. Let me drive one
car and Corrie or Rupert the other. I'll promise
not to take any ditches, if you consent."</p>

<p>"Great scheme," Corrie called, overhearing.
"I'll take the red near-car home, Isabel."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," Isabel vetoed decidedly. "Mr.
Gerard is going to take me home and I shall learn
a lot from watching him drive. You can take
Flavia in your roadster; Mr. Rupert will ride in
the rumble seat."</p>

<p>Being a gentleman, Gerard compelled his expression
to evidence pleasant acquiescence. But
he was not soothed by the unclouded smile Flavia
sent her designated escort.</p>

<p>"Corrie doesn't mind taking me, do you, dear?"
she covered her brother's chagrin.</p>

<p>"I surely don't, Other Fellow," he heartily
corroborated, coming across to his sister, although
the change in his transparent face betrayed his
discomfiture at the slight. "You and I have had
many a good spin. In you go! Come up behind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Rupert; there is more room here than on the other
machine."</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Rupert would rather ride with
us, anyhow," Flavia declared, her laughing eyes
questioning the mechanician. "I fancied, once
or twice on the way over, that he would have
preferred to have you or Mr. Gerard driving."</p>

<p>"I ain't making any scornful denials," admitted
Rupert, as he stepped in front to crank the motor
for Corrie. "I've always looked forward to being
killed in a larger machine, myself."</p>

<p>Isabel did not at once enter her own car.</p>

<p>"I can't fasten this glove without taking off
the other, and then I can't fasten the other without
taking off this," she complained. "I really
believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>So, the last the three in the departing roadster
saw of the two on the pier, Allan Gerard was
engaged in buttoning Isabel's glove, while her
wind-blown veils fluttered across his shoulders and
her flushed, provocative face bent over the task
beside his.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>IV</h2>
<h3>ISABEL</h3>

<p>Isabel, in the clinging knitted coat that displayed
every attractive line of her athletic figure,
her cheeks reddened by triumph and the salt wind,
her gray eyes lifted in challenging coquetry, was
a sufficiently pleasant sight to dispel mere vexation.
And Gerard had no right to feel more than
annoyance at a disappointment of which she supposedly
knew nothing.</p>

<p>"I ran away with you because I didn't want
to ride home with Corrie," she confided, when the
last button-hole was achieved. "You don't mind&mdash;much?"</p>

<p>"I am overwhelmed by the honor," Gerard assured.
He was neither surly enough to refuse the
light play to which she invited him, nor anchorite
enough to be insensible to the flattery of being
sought. "But how did Prince Corrie offend his
sovereign lady?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be telling! You know, we
are <i>not</i> engaged."</p>

<p>"Not yet?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. And the last time we were out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
alone together, he&mdash;he asked me to see if the oil
was running through that little cup on the dash."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>They were in the car now, Gerard behind the
steering-wheel. Isabel leaned down to touch her
fingers to the dash, turning her vivid-hued, consciously
alluring face across her shoulder to the
companion so close beside her, the auburn curls
tumbled about her forehead and her mouth tempting
as a small scarlet fruit.</p>

<p>"And then, we were like this when&mdash;guess what
Corrie did?"</p>

<p>It was not in the least difficult to guess what
the enamoured Corrie had done. But Gerard shook
his head, schooling his mirthful eyes.</p>

<p>"I could not, possibly, Miss Rose. I am very
dull."</p>

<p>"Well, what would <i>you</i> have done?"</p>

<p>"I? I should have shut both eyes and recalled
St. Francis' rules of deportment."</p>

<p>Isabel straightened herself, leaning back and
folding her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>"That's what Corrie did not do," she stated.
"So I will not ride with him. It was bad taste."</p>

<p>"I imagine Corrie found the taste most pleasant."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Have I guessed wrong?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"You said that you were dull, Mr. Gerard."</p>

<p>"Then the guess is wrong. Poor Corrie!"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>"You think a great deal about Corrie."</p>

<p>"Yes. We are friends," Gerard quietly answered.</p>

<p>She was clever enough to recognize the bar he
set to flirtation with the woman loved by the man
he gave that name, and she regarded the obstacle
as a challenge. She was not sufficiently old or
fine to realize that such bars are not crossed by
such men. If Gerard had loved her or believed
she might love him, he must have left his friend's
house; as Corrie would have left Gerard's in like
case. As a matter of fact, Gerard was perfectly
aware of the immunity of both parties and that
Isabel was merely seeking temporary diversion&mdash;experimenting
with the possibilities of her own
heady youth.</p>

<p>A forking of the road supplied a new subject
for discussion.</p>

<p>"Turn to the left," Isabel directed, sitting
erect.</p>

<p>Surprised, Gerard checked the machine.</p>

<p>"We did not come that way, Miss Rose."</p>

<p>"Of course not; you came by the long route,
past the Goodwin farm. This is a better road."</p>

<p>"Better?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>She followed his gaze down the vista of slippery,
rut-grooved mud, and colored.</p>

<p>"A shorter road, then," she amended petulantly.
"I am sure I don't care&mdash;go the long way if you
wish. The storm is blowing back again, but I
can stand the rain."</p>

<p>Gerard hastily turned into the wretched travesty
of a road.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; I only wondered if you
were quite certain of the route," he apologized.</p>

<p>There ensued a period of silence. The little
car slipped and wallowed through sliding mud
and yellow puddles.</p>

<p>"I hope you do not drive here, yourself," Gerard
observed.</p>

<p>"Do you think I should be afraid?"</p>

<p>"I think you might have serious trouble. There
is a deep ditch on either side, while the road is
both narrow and slippery."</p>

<p>"I can drive anywhere. Ask Corrie."</p>

<p>"I suspect he is a biassed judge. But I should
not have believed he would let you drive here."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;&mdash;I never did except in dry weather.
I knew <i>you</i> would not mind any road and could
drive in anything, so it did not matter."</p>

<p>"Please consider the compliment more than
appreciated, mademoiselle," Gerard smiled.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"There is going to be a splash when we strike
that puddle ahead; had you not better draw in
your frock?"</p>

<p>She caught her white serge skirts around her
and shrank nearer to her companion with a gurgle
of dismayed laughter.</p>

<p>"Let me get in the middle. Uh, what a muddy
swamp! Oh&mdash;my face!"</p>

<p>In fact, the water had splashed as the car struck
the pool where a rain-swollen brook had overflowed
the road. As Gerard turned to the girl,
she lifted a face sprinkled with drops which she
strove to remove with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Is it off?" she questioned. "Please look
carefully. <i>All</i> off?"</p>

<p>He was obliged to scrutinize the handsome countenance
offered for inspection at close range.</p>

<p>"A trifle of mud, still," he admitted.</p>

<p>"Where? Here?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;more to the left. Beneath the eye&mdash;the
other eye."</p>

<p>"This place?"</p>

<p>"Not quite."</p>

<p>It was incredible, the length of time that small
spot evaded Isabel's questing handkerchief, and
the futility of Gerard's directions. He was
obliged to halt the car, at last.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little higher&mdash;not so much. There! No,
not so low."</p>

<p>With a gesture of mock despair, she gave him
the fragrant square of linen.</p>

<p>"Wipe it off," she requested resignedly. "I
can't motor all over Long Island with a dirty face.
There is no one in sight for miles; wipe it off
and never tell."</p>

<p>"I am very clumsy," he demurred.</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped."</p>

<p>Gerard might have echoed the exclamation. But
he accepted the handkerchief and deftly, if with
inward embarrassment, removed the stain from
the ruddy cheek presented.</p>

<p>"It can't be off, Mr. Gerard?"</p>

<p>"Pardon, it is gone."</p>

<p>"You hardly touched it," doubtingly.</p>

<p>"If you could see&mdash;&mdash;" he began in defense
of his work.</p>

<p>"Look once more."</p>

<p>He obeyed, impersonally and coolly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, indeed," he asserted.</p>

<p>She glanced up at him through her long lashes,
and flung herself back in her seat.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Shall we go on?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The operation and the drive that preceded it
had occupied considerable time. It was an hour
since the party had separated at the yacht club's
pier. The brief interval of comparative clearness
had given place to dark skies across which the
capricious wind herded masses of gray cloud. And
presently several drops of rain fell and trickled
down the wind-shield of the car.</p>

<p>"Hurry," Isabel urged, sitting up with renewed
animation. "It is going to pour."</p>

<p>"The little machine isn't capable of much
hurrying on this road," Gerard regretted. "She
hasn't any speed, of course. How far have we
left to go?"</p>

<p>"A long way, seven or eight miles. We haven't
passed the country club, yet."</p>

<p>"But Corrie drove over in an hour!"</p>

<p>"With his big car, yes," she retorted. "Perhaps
this was not the best way, after all. But it
would take longer to go back, now, than to keep
on."</p>

<p>This was obvious. There was nothing to do
except force the skidding, panting automobile to
maintain its best gait.</p>

<p>They were destined to lose that race. As they
came opposite a low brick building set amidst rolling
green slopes and stretches of flag-dotted turf,
the storm overtook them.</p>

<p>"Up the driveway," Isabel cried. "We can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
just make it. This is the country club&mdash;we'll
'phone home where we are staying."</p>

<p>Gerard sent the car up the wide gravelled path.
An attendant was waiting to receive them, another
assumed charge of the automobile, and Isabel's
escort found himself standing beside her on the
veranda with rather confused ideas of how the
affair had been accomplished.</p>

<p>"Koma says there is no one else here," she
informed him. "We have all the place to ourselves.
How it rains!"</p>

<p>It certainly was raining, raining violently and
steadily, a gray downpour from a gray sky. She
paused to look before continuing.</p>

<p>"I'll 'phone to Flavia, first of all. I can see
we are going to have a long wait. Koma will get
us the best luncheon he knows how. Aren't you
hungry? I am. Come in."</p>

<p>Gerard uttered some reply. He was profoundly
vexed at his situation, without being able to blame
himself for it or to fix any actual fault upon Isabel.
She had already turned away to enter the hall, and
presently he heard the tinkle of the telephone bell,
followed by her high-pitched voice.</p>

<p>"One one seven? Martin, I want Miss Rose.
Yes, it is I. Oh!&mdash;&mdash;We're at the country club,
Corrie. No, we didn't get lost; we just chose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
that road.... Not a bit, it was good sport.
We're having luncheon together, here, and then I
suppose we will play billiards until the rain stops.
Tell Flavia not to worry; we'll get home by dinner-time,
and we're enjoying ourselves.... Not
wet, just splashed. Mr. Gerard spoiled a handkerchief
drying me, that's all the damage. Good-by."</p>

<p>She reappeared on the threshold, complacently
satisfied. She had removed her hood and veils,
shaken her ruddy hair into becoming disorder, and
knew herself at her best.</p>

<p>"You are enjoying yourself, aren't you?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"Certainly," Gerard responded, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Why not come in, then? Which do you like
most to commence a luncheon&mdash;&mdash;Blue Points or
little clams? Corrie and I quarrel over that
every time we are out together. He is as obstinate
as, as&mdash;Corrie!"</p>

<p>"Clams," said he, at a venture. He had a
vague recollection of seeing Corrie dismiss oysters
with scorn, and he felt viciously contrary.</p>

<p>"Why, so do I," agreed Isabel winningly. "Let
us order some."</p>

<p>One cannot be disagreeable to a young girl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
under one's care, who also is in a sense one's
hostess. The luncheon was sufficiently gay. The
rain fell incessantly, beating against the diamond-paned
windows, gurgling down eaves and gutter-ways.</p>

<p>"We should have sailed home in the <i>Dear Me</i>,"
Isabel declared. "I am sure there is enough water
on the roads. Why did we not think of it?"</p>

<p>She detached a chrysanthemum petal from the
vase of blossoms central on the table, and dropped
it into her finger-bowl, watching the agitation of a
diminutive scarlet-and-black beetle perched upon
the sinking leaf.</p>

<p>"An execution?" Gerard inquired.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes, pouting prettily, and
nodded.</p>

<p>"I hate those bugs," she explained. "Ugly
animals! We put them in and wager a box of
bon-bons on how long they last. If it is still alive
at the end of five minutes, I lose. If it is drowned,
I win."</p>

<p>"Does Corrie play that game with you?"</p>

<p>"N'no. Corrie doesn't like it. He will step
off of a sidewalk into the mud to avoid treading on
a cricket. Do you suppose I never play with
any one except my cousin? Will you try this
wager? <i>You're</i> not silly?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, if I may. If that lady-bug is alive five
minutes from now, I win? No other conditions?"</p>

<p>"None," gleefully. "Take your watch. You'll
lose, he's weakening now."</p>

<p>Gerard leaned across, lifted the struggling beetle
upon his finger-tip, and restored it to the safe
refuge of the chrysanthemum bouquet.</p>

<p>"I believe he will live some time," he soberly
predicted.</p>

<p>The girl stared, frowned, and laughed.</p>

<p>"No fair! No fair! That's not the game,
Mr. Gerard."</p>

<p>"No? Then I will send the bon-bons."</p>

<p>"Chocolates."</p>

<p>"They shall be chocolates."</p>

<p>"And I may put back the nasty beetle?"</p>

<p>"On no account; I have ransomed him."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," she shrugged, rising. "I'll
take refuge in billiards for the next game. Corrie
taught me to play, but I can beat him, now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he doesn't watch his game when his
opponent is his cousin."</p>

<p>"Why, what else should he watch?" she wondered,
arching her brows a trifle too innocently.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine, if you do not know," Gerard
dryly responded, and held open the door for her
to pass out.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>In the billiard room, Isabel rolled her sleeves
above her elbows as a preliminary measure.</p>

<p>"I haven't had that off for a year," she confided,
indicating a flexible platinum and turquoise
bracelet encircling her firm, sun-browned arm.</p>

<p>"You are fond of it?" her companion inferred.
"It is a beautiful bit of work, indeed."</p>

<p>"I like it well enough. That isn't the reason,
though. You see, it locks, and after Corrie put
it on my arm he kept the key. He says he will
give it to me on my wedding day. But it isn't
worth that."</p>

<p>"Worth&mdash;&mdash;?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Getting married. Will you play me even?"</p>

<p>"Pray fix any odds you choose, Miss Rose.
How many points does Corrie usually give you?"</p>

<p>This time Isabel's stare of surprise was genuine.</p>

<p>"I meant, how many points should I allow
<i>you</i>," she corrected arrogantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me!" he submitted. "Suppose,
in that case, we play for an even score."</p>

<p>The storm did not abate. The wind drove the
rain before it in glistening gray sheets, the steady
drumming of the downpour accompanied the click
of meeting ivory balls and the occasional speech
of the players. After a time, a deep-belled Mission
clock in the hall struck four.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>A sharp, incredulous cry from the girl rang
out, after an interval of silence in the room.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, you've won!"</p>

<p>"So I have," acknowledged her antagonist.
"Shall I apologize?"</p>

<p>Isabel started to speak, and checked herself.
She had been chiefly intent upon her own accomplishment,
and Gerard's playing was of a deceptive
leisureliness and tranquillity.</p>

<p>"How many did you make in that last run?"
she asked, finally.</p>

<p>"Only seventeen."</p>

<p>"You can't do it again."</p>

<p>"One never can tell."</p>

<p>"Play," she defied.</p>

<p>Gerard glanced hopelessly at the streaming
windows.</p>

<p>"It is growing late," he demurred.</p>

<p>"Not late, yet. Besides, we can't go out in
that weather with an open automobile. They know
at home where we are."</p>

<p>They did; that was precisely the core of
Gerard's exasperation and unrest. What impressions
would this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te afternoon convey to
Corrie? And what would Flavia think of her
guest's guardianship of her cousin? He picked
up his cue with enforced resignation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>The clock had struck the half-hour, when a
long blast from an electric horn pierced through
the clamor of the storm.</p>

<p>"Another motor-party caught out," Isabel
hazarded, her tone decidedly cross. She was losing
again, and she did not like the experience.
"Your play. You seem to find it more amusing
to look out the window."</p>

<p>Gerard was spared reply. The billiard-room
door was pushed open by the Japanese steward
and a figure in gleaming rain-proof attire appeared
on the threshold&mdash;the figure of a chauffeur, cap
in hand.</p>

<p>"Lenoir!" Isabel exclaimed.</p>

<p>The chauffeur saluted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rose sent the limousine to convey mademoiselle
and Mr. Gerard," he informed them, in
his precise, Parisian-flavored English.</p>

<p>"My uncle is home?"</p>

<p>"I had just driven Mr. Rose home from the
city, mademoiselle, before he telephoned to the
garage that I should come here."</p>

<p>She tossed her cue upon the table, recklessly
scattering the balls, and turned toward the door.</p>

<p>"Bring our wraps, Koma," she bade. "We had
better go."</p>

<p>Gerard contemplated Lenoir with marked kindness.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a bad day to be out," he commented, in
following Isabel from the room, and passed into
the chauffeur's hand a gratuity out of all proportion
to the occasion.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Lenoir, demurely.</p>

<p>The drive home was short and uninteresting.
On the veranda of the Rose villa Corrie was waiting
to meet the returning two, upon the limousine's
arrival.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the slow traveling I ever saw,
this is the limit," he greeted them derisively;
"From noon until five o'clock! Fancy!"</p>

<p>"Never mind our driving; we have had a fine
time," Isabel retorted, with pettish tartness.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, no doubt. I wouldn't have interrupted,
myself. It was father who did it, when
he came in. He said you'd want some dinner
to-night."</p>

<p>He smiled at Gerard as cordially as ever, but
there was a wistfulness underlying his expression
that inspired the older man with a hearty desire
to shake Isabel Rose. She could watch her young
lover's emotions with the same diverted interest
with which she had watched the struggles of the
tiny black-and-scarlet beetle drowning in her
finger-bowl.</p>

<p>"I wish you had been with us, Corrie," was all
Gerard found to say.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the parted curtains, the library presented
such a graceful interior study as certain
French artists have delighted in drawing. In the
octagonal, book-lined room of rich hues and soft
lights, Flavia and her father were seated together;
busied in pleasant comradeship at the table whose
polished surface was littered with letters, books
of household accounts, and all those dainty metal
and crystal trinkets the jeweller conceives necessary
to the writer. Evidently they had found
refreshment desirable, for a diminutive tea-table
still stood near Flavia, while a pushed-back chair
beneath which a young Great Dane hound lay
asleep indicated that Corrie had been one of the
group.</p>

<p>"Back, are you?" Mr. Rose called cheerily, to
the two in the hall, leaning back in his chair to
view them more easily. "When I heard where you
were marooned, I guessed it was about time for
a rescue. You children oughtn't to try roundabout
country roads with a storm blowing up."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gerard wanted to go that way," Isabel
alleged, with perfect assurance. "I told him to
do as he chose."</p>

<p>That distortion of facts was too much to be
endured, with Corrie listening and Flavia a witness.
Gerard's chivalry momentarily lapsed and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
he struck back with all the effectiveness of superior
experience.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," he confirmed, carefully distinct.
"I naturally wanted to get Miss Rose
safely at home as soon as possible, and since she
said that road was the shortest route, I took it,
of course."</p>

<p>"The <i>shortest</i>?" Corrie echoed, astounded.
"The&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke the speech in time, hastily discreet.
Isabel crimsoned hotly; the glance she darted at
her late escort was not dovelike. It was Flavia
who brought relief to the situation, as usual.</p>

<p>"These Long Island roads are outrageously
misleading," she offered light suggestion, rising
with a smiling gesture of excuse to her father.
"Isa and I often lose our way when we drive out
together. Don't you want to change your damp
things, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented her cousin, sullenly. "It's
time to make ready for dinner, anyhow."</p>

<p>Corrie held aside the curtain for the girls to
pass out. His blue eyes were dancing in pure mischief
and relief. All the household understood
Isabel's propensity for flirtation&mdash;and its utter
lack of significance. If she had detained Gerard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
not Gerard her, her lover-cousin had no ground
for especial apprehension.</p>

<p>"Punk weather," he commented, coming back.</p>

<p>"Dullest I ever experienced," supplemented his
guest decidedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose set a paper-weight on the letter open
before him, and lit a cigar.</p>

<p>"We were discussing the buying of another
automobile, Gerard, when you came in," he imparted.
"Come sit down for half an hour before
we dress&mdash;we not needing so long as the ladies
for it&mdash;and give us your advice on the choice."</p>

<p>"And I'll give you one of my monogram cigarettes,"
volunteered Corrie, slipping a hand affectionately
through Gerard's arm. "Oh, no&mdash;I
don't smoke them, but I like to carry them. And
when you want something extra fine, you ask
Corwin B. Rose for one of his smokes. Let's sit
here, together."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>V</h2>
<h3>THE VASE OF AL-MANSOR</h3>

<p>On the threshold of his father's model garage
Corrie stopped, surveying the scene presented in
the centre of the huge, lofty stone room, bare
except for the five automobiles ranged around and
their countless appurtenances disposed upon walls
and shelves.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but when did you two last wash?"
he jeered.</p>

<p>The two men beside the Mercury racing car
looked up at the figure in the sunny doorway.</p>

<p>"I don't care to try to prove that I ever did,"
returned Gerard. "The evidence is against me.
But Rupert had his beauty bath this morning,
all right. You're looking rather disarranged,
yourself; perhaps the course was a trifle dusty."</p>

<p>They laughed silently across at one another.
The trim garments of all three men were gray
with dust and oil, their faces were streaked and
spotted with the caked road-soil. There was little
difference in color between Gerard's brown ripples
of hair, Corrie's blonde locks and the black head
of the mechanician who bent over the motor.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"If this is practice work, <i>what</i> is the race
going to be like?" speculated Corrie, dragging off
his gauntlets. The recent speed-exhilaration was
still heavily upon him; as with his sister, the
darker shading of brows and lashes always gave
his fair-tinted face a warm vividness of expression.
"The course is in fierce shape, already. I say&mdash;why
did you especially warn me that the road
wouldn't be fit for fast going until to-morrow,
then get out in your own machine and break all
practice records for the fastest lap? Trying to
keep me out of your way, or to break your neck
and Rupert's?"</p>

<p>"The first, certainly," Gerard asserted.
"Really, I didn't mean to do any speeding to-day,
Corrie, but when I saw the white road ahead, I&mdash;think
something slipped."</p>

<p>"You're a cheerful hypocrite, all right. Here,
catch, baseballist!"</p>

<p>Gerard retreated a step and deftly caught the
dripping missile as it hurtled across the garage.</p>

<p>"You ought to wring out your league sponges,"
he reproved. "Thanks; I was wondering how I
could take this face into the house, unless I got
Rupert to turn the hose on me. You see, I might
meet some one."</p>

<p>"You'd meet Flavia," Corrie declared, busying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
himself with his own ablutions. "She's out there
in the flowing arbor, sewing some gimcrack thing
and pretending she hasn't been worrying because
I was out on the course. She comes downstairs
every morning to see me start&mdash;you know that&mdash;and
then sits around all day watching until I
come in again. None of that for Isabel; she's a
sport."</p>

<p>Gerard shook the water from his thick hair and
finished the perfunctory toilet without replying.
But as he passed Rupert, he dropped a light hand
on the mechanician's shoulder.</p>

<p>"When you marry, Jack Rupert, will the girl
be a sport?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"My wedding cards ain't paining me bad just
now."</p>

<p>"Well, but suppose the case."</p>

<p>The black eyes lifted for a moment from the
task in hand.</p>

<p>"I guess I'd be sport enough for one house,"
Rupert impassively pronounced. "I hate a
crowd."</p>

<p>Gerard nodded to the boy across the garage,
his face gleaming into mirth.</p>

<p>"Coals to Newcastle," he signified. "Everyone
doesn't like to live shop."</p>

<p>There was the splashing thud of an overturned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
bucket. As Gerard passed out the door, Corrie
overtook him.</p>

<p>"Gerard," he panted, "Gerard, you said that
purposely! You meant to tell me that&mdash;that Isabel&mdash;that
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Gerard regarded him quietly, a little smile
curving his lips.</p>

<p>"You meant to tell me that I needn't worry
about you and Isabel; that you've seen I want
her, and you won't cut in? You meant that?"</p>

<p>The smile crept to Gerard's eyes, but he remained
mute. With a quick breath Corrie grasped
his companion's hand and squeezed it ardently.</p>

<p>"You're <i>big</i>, Allan Gerard. And kind. For
I've been watching, these ten days, and you could
get her if you tried."</p>

<p>He turned back into the building before contradiction
was possible. After a moment, Gerard
went on down the path between the althea bushes.</p>

<p>The "flowing arbor" of Corrie's description
was a decorative masterpiece of Mr. Rose's own
design; a large, pink marble fountain, surrounded
by a pink-columned arcade strewn with rugs and
cushions. Whatever its architectural faults, it was
a fairy-tale place of gurgling water and soft
shadows, shot through with the tints of silver
spray, rosy stone and deep green turf. Flavia was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
seated here, in the summer-warm sunshine of early
October that had succeeded the storms of the
previous week, a long strip of varicolored embroidery
lying across her lap and the overfed
Persian kitten nestling against her light gown.</p>

<p>"Corrie is home," Gerard announced, pausing
in one of the arched openings. "But I suppose
you saw him come in, from here."</p>

<p>The young girl lifted to him the frank welcome
of her glance and smile, with their pathetic shade
of hostess dignity.</p>

<p>"I saw you both come in," she confirmed. "One
sees a great deal from this watch-tower. But it
is good of you to tell me; you know how glad I
am when he is back. Will you not rest before
you go into the house? Corrie always comes here
first; to gather strength, he says, to climb the
terrace steps."</p>

<p>"I am not fit," he deprecated. "I would soil
your purple with my dust and poison, your Venetian
atmosphere with gasoline fumes."</p>

<p>"Corrie does it."</p>

<p>"Corrie is privileged. The first time I ever
saw you, you were watching Corrie. You made
me feel that I lived in a barn."</p>

<p>"A&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A blank, impersonal, vacant set of rooms. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
house where, if I were brought in on a shutter,
there would be no one except the undertaker to
pull down the shades."</p>

<p>Flavia winced, shocked out of her calm.</p>

<p>"Please do not! I&mdash;please do not say those
things."</p>

<p>"There, you see. I do not even know how to
talk to you properly. It doesn't worry me to
think about just dying and I forgot that other
people dislike the subject. Now, it was living
that made me envy Corrie and feel melancholy."</p>

<p>Flavia drew the silk thread with slow accuracy.
Her pulses were commencing to beat heavy strokes,
she dared not raise her troubled eyes to the dominant,
self-possessed man opposite. There was
a pause.</p>

<p>"In novels," Gerard mused, "when a man sees
the woman who locks the wheels of his fancy, he
drops everything else and follows her until he
gets&mdash;his answer. But in real life we're pretty
stupid; we let circumstances interfere, or we don't
quite realize what has happened to us, we don't
do the right thing, anyway. Sometimes we're lucky
enough to get another chance. If we do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The gush and ripple of the fountain, the rustle
of the broad-leaved lilies as the changing breeze
sent the spray pattering across them; filled pleas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>antly
the lapses of his leisurely speech. Flavia
was acutely conscious of his steady gaze upon her
bent head, and the unhurried certainty with which
he was moving toward his chosen goal. Only, what
was that goal? She remembered Isabel's sureness
of her own attraction, Isabel's deliberate monopoly
of Gerard's attention whenever possible during the
last ten days, and Corrie's assertion that his cousin
was "just the kind of girl Gerard would like."
Yet, he was saying this to her, Flavia. And suddenly
she was almost sure of what she never had
dared imagine.</p>

<p>She had no thought that Gerard might be hesitating
in uncertain humility before the delicate
maidenhood that invested her like a fine atmosphere
forbidding approach. She was not even dimly
aware that her averted face controlled to soft
impassivity, the intent gaze on her work which
veiled her eyes beneath their heavy lashes, the regular
movement of her slender fingers as she sewed,
conveyed an impression of unmoved serenity that
might have quelled a vainer man than Allan
Gerard. Yet it was so, and he temporized; not
knowing that for her there were three people in
the arcade, the third Isabel, and not daring to
continue his broken sentence.</p>

<p>"I have been wondering if you ever translated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
your name," he remarked, when silence verged on
embarrassment. "I have wondered many times if
it were just chance that called you so."</p>

<p>"My Mother was Flavia Corwin; I am named for
her. What does it mean?" she answered, surprised.</p>

<p>Just for an instant she looked at him, and in
the one encounter of glances innocently undid all
her reserve had built up. Gerard's color ran up
under his clear skin like a girl's, brilliant-eyed, he
took a step into the arcade.</p>

<p>"It's too late in the season to tell you out here,"
he demurred. "I'll send you the translation this
evening, if I may. There's something else I'd like
to tell you, but I've got to find some civilized clothing,
first. Essex lost his head for approaching
the Queen in his riding-dress, and I'm risking
more. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hurry up, you two!" hailed Corrie's injured
voice, the ring of his step sounded in the stone
arcade. "It's six o'clock now. Come on in."</p>

<p>"I'll come," Gerard answered the summons,
again his warm, sparkling gaze caught and held
Flavia's as, startled, she raised her head. "I was
telling Miss Rose that I must get rid of this road
dust. But I wasn't thinking of eating, then."</p>

<p>Scarlet rushed over Flavia's face and neck. As
Corrie took gay possession of Gerard and bore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
him off, she sank back in her chair, winding her
fingers hard into the embroidery. Not the omnivorous
Isabel's, this! There was nothing to fear,
ever again. She had the perfect certainty that
Gerard would complete that purpose of his the
next time they met. And they would meet in an
hour. Suddenly she caught up the drowsy kitten
and hid her face against the soft living toy.</p>

<p>They did meet in an hour, but it was on the
way to dinner, and the exuberant Corrie held the
reins of conversation.</p>

<p>"I've discharged Dean," was his first announcement.
"Take those oysters away from in front
of me, Perkins; I want my soup right now and a
lot of it&mdash;about a gallon. Never mind anyone
else; I haven't had anything but sandwiches since
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Discharged your mechanician one day before
the race?" marvelled Gerard. "What will
you do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going out to the garage after dinner
to hire him over again. He's used to it. Now,
I suppose that if you fired Jack Rupert, you'd
never see him again."</p>

<p>"I certainly would not."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the difference. I'm afraid of
Rupert, myself. Dean hasn't any dignity."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Neither have you," observed Isabel bitingly.
"You're worse than Dean. I saw you kick Frederick
the Great all across the veranda yesterday,
then lead him around the kitchen and feed him
porterhouse steak."</p>

<p>"That was remorse," Mr. Rose suggested,
coolly amused. He looked across at Gerard, as
at the only other grown person present. "You'd
best take a porterhouse steak to Dean when you
go, Corwin B. It's a fine temper you've got."</p>

<p>"All right, sir, if you say it. I guess Dean
would eat a porterhouse, if he isn't a Great Dane
puppy. But I saw a man to-day in a temper
that makes anything I ever did read like a chapter
from Patient Griselda."</p>

<p>"He must have been a lunatic," Isabel kindly
inferred.</p>

<p>Her cousin put his elbows on the table and contemplated
her with mock reproach; looking rather
nearer his sixteenth year than his nineteenth in
this mood of effervescent gayety. Ever since his
interview with Gerard, in the garage that afternoon,
his high spirits had been unquenchable.</p>

<p>"You're cross, Isabel," he stated frankly.
"Where did you get the grouch? That's a stunning
purple frock you've got on."</p>

<p>"It isn't, it's mauve," corrected Isabel, but she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
smiled and smoothed a chiffon ruffle. "Who was
your man, then, Corrie?"</p>

<p>"He was the French driver of the Bluette car,
and he came into the judges' stand to make a complaint
against another fellow who wouldn't give
him the road. Kept getting in front, you know,
whenever the Bluette wanted to pass, and cutting
it off so it had to fall behind. He was in a French
calm, all right, and I don't wonder. But I don't
believe anyone could really carry it through, could
they, Gerard?"</p>

<p>Gerard roused himself from his study of Flavia,
as she sat in her ivory-tinted lace gown at the foot
of the table, her small head bent under its weight
of gleaming fair hair. The massively handsome
room, with its rich hues of gilded leather, mellow
Eastern rugs and hangings, carved wood and
glinting metal, enchanted him as a background for
her dainty youth as if he had never seen it there
before or might again. It was difficult for him
to look away.</p>

<p>"Carry it through?" he repeated. "Of
course, easily."</p>

<p>"Not with some drivers! Not with me!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I wouldn't stand it. Because I'd
drive through the car ahead if it tried to keep me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
back. Oh, I'd have them out of my way&mdash;you're
<i>laughing</i> at me, Allan Gerard!"</p>

<p>Gerard was certainly laughing, and the others
with him.</p>

<p>"If I were Dean, I wouldn't wait to be fired,
Corrie; I'd resign," he rallied. "Some day I'll
challenge you to a game of auto tag, and show
you that trick."</p>

<p>"You can't; I'd get by," Corrie retorted, his
violet-blue eyes afire with excitement.</p>

<p>"Instead of you two fighting about that nonsense,
you might take me around the course in
one of your cars," Isabel remarked gloomily.
"I've asked you often enough."</p>

<p>"You'll not do that," Mr. Rose pronounced with
decision. "It's not fit and I won't have it. And
I'm tired of hearing you sulk at Corrie and Gerard
because they've got the sense to say no. You'll
keep out of the racing cars and off the race track,
my girl. Flavia, if you don't make your brother
stop eating nuts, he'll be ashamed to meet a
squirrel in the woods."</p>

<p>There was open mutiny in the glance Isabel
darted at her uncle, but she said nothing. Mr.
Rose was not contradicted in his own house by
anyone.</p>

<p>"Nuts agree with me, sir," Corrie protested,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
aggrieved. "Besides, I feel as if I had to celebrate
somehow; I have had such a bully day."
He leaned back in his chair, turning to Gerard
his gaze of shining acknowledgment and measureless
content. "I don't think I ever spent such an
all-round good old day, just all right all through.
I shall have to tie a gold medal on the calendar,
or mark it with a white stone, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or drop a pearl in the vase of Al-Mansor,"
Gerard suggested. His own feelings were not
very far removed from Corrie's, that night.</p>

<p>"What is that?" Isabel questioned. "I never
heard that story. What is the vase of Al-Mansor?"</p>

<p>"A legend of the days of the caliphs. If you
care about it, some day I will find a copy to
send."</p>

<p>"Some day! I want to hear it now."</p>

<p>"Tell us, with all the trimmings," Corrie urged,
"No sliding around the flowery parts and cutting
scenes, but the full performance. Flavia loves
that sort of thing, too; she and I grew up on the
Arabian Nights and Byron and Irving. We
dramatized 'The Fall of Granada,' for the toy
theatre, but Bulwer was dead, so it didn't matter.</p>

<p>"Perkins, up in my den you'll find a five-pound
box of Turkish Delight, sent to-night from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
candy shop; bring it here to help the Oriental
atmosphere."</p>

<p>Flavia looked up, and Gerard caught her eyes,
no longer quite untroubled before his own.</p>

<p>"What a set of comparisons to face," he deprecated.
"Shall I dare it, Miss Rose?"</p>

<p>"Would you leave us to suffer all the pangs
of unsatisfied curiosity?" she wondered. "To
dream all night of elusive pearls that disappear in
their vase as Cleopatra's in her goblet of vinegar?"</p>

<p>Mr. Rose took a cigar and a match, nodding
humorously at his guest.</p>

<p>"You're in for it," he signified. "Better get
it over."</p>

<p>"And no cutting," exacted Corrie, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>"Very well, then; pray imagine yourselves in
the bazaar, and remember this isn't my fault,"
Gerard submitted. He paused, assembling his
recollections. "On ascending the throne at Bagdad,
in the full noon of the glory of the caliphs;
it is told that Al-Mamoun, the son of Haroun-al-Raschid,
the great-grandson of Al-Mansor, received
from the former vizier a small golden vase.</p>

<p>"'Lord of the East, newly-risen Sun of the
true believers,' said the vizier, 'your great-grandfather
of venerated memory caused to be made
this vase, proposing to place therein a pearl for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
every day of perfect happiness he should pass.
And when he received the vase from the goldsmith,
he complained that the vase was too small.
But, alas, the mighty Al-Mansor died without ever
putting in a single pearl, for the day when the
vase came home he learned that his loved sultana
plotted against his life.</p>

<p>"'After many years, in his turn came to rule
your illustrious father, Haroun the Wise, and
took the vase. He, the great king, who never
travelled without a hundred scholars in his train,
who built a school for poor children beside every
mosque, he the magnificent in war and peace, in
all his long reign enriched the vase by two pearls;
the day of his coronation and the day of his death;
the day before he saw Marida the Beautiful and
the day he forgot her forever. Now, Commander
of the Faithful, according to my charge I deliver
the vase to you, with hope that your joys may
exhaust the sea of pearls.'</p>

<p>"Hearing, Al-Mamoun fell into profound musing.</p>

<p>"'Vizier,' he said, 'I cannot mark the day I
began to reign, who loved my father and take his
place with tears, and the day of my death no man
knows. But, by the favor of Allah, I will add
one pearl to the vase while I live.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"The next morning many workmen came to the
palace. Around the fairest part of the garden
they reared a lofty wall, within its circle they
placed everything which the king might desire.
On the day appointed, in that spot assembled his
favorite musicians, the scholars in whose conversation
he most delighted, the captains whose
faces reminded him of victories and the poets
whose words fell like drops from the spring that
bubbles before Allah's throne in Paradise. Only,
because women had troubled the days of Al-Mansor
and Haroun, no woman was admitted.</p>

<p>"With pomp, music and rejoicing, Al-Mamoun
moved at sunrise to the garden of delights that
was to shelter him from the world for one day.
But, as his foot touched the threshold, a great
cry of lamentation went through the palace.</p>

<p>"'What now?' demanded the king, halting.</p>

<p>"A guard of the serail answered, his brow in
the dust:</p>

<p>"'Lord, the sultana has drowned herself in the
Court of Fountains, because of grief that your
day of perfect happiness could be passed without
her.'</p>

<p>"Then Al-Mamoun drew back his foot and returned
to the palace, knowing that from him the
golden vase would claim no pearls."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is all?" Isabel asked expectantly.</p>

<p>"What more could there be, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"There might be a moral," Corrie suggested,
leaning his folded arms on the table, his interested
eyes fixed upon the story-teller.</p>

<p>"When I read the Arabian Nights, I found out
that Oriental tales have no morals," dryly observed
Mr. Rose. "A man who had been brought up
with the Blarney Stone for a teething-ring once
sold me an unexpurgated edition de luxe, with
illustrations, so I ought to know."</p>

<p>"I never saw it, sir!"</p>

<p>"No, Corwin B., you did not. You can if you
want to, by coming down to my office, where it is
still lying in the packing-box it came in. I don't
think you want to. Gerard's story isn't there."</p>

<p>"Its moral seems to be that women are a
nuisance," Isabel commented, her manner injured.</p>

<p>"That would not be a moral, it would be a
falsehood," Gerard demurred. "No, I fancy the
moral might be, do not challenge Fate to a duel.
Are you considering our nonsense, Miss Rose?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the story," Flavia amended.
"I was wondering if the kings would not soon
have filled the vase had they been content to mark
each happy hour, and whether a wise treasurer of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
happiness would not find a vase filled with seed-pearls
where they found a vase empty."</p>

<p>"Exactly! You have found the secret, no
doubt. Moral: do not ask too much."</p>

<p>"A day too much?" marvelled Corrie. "Why,
I expect a lifetime!" He flung back his head,
looking around the smiling circle. "Well, why
not? What's a lifetime, anyhow? Not half
enough to get all the fun there is in living, as long
as you do no harm by it. And who wants to do
any harm when there is so much else to do? Not
anyone in his right mind. Anyway, I've got to-day's
pearl canned, and <i>it</i> can't get away. And
I can think of lots of others I've had, if I could
go back for them."</p>

<p>"Shall I guess the name of Al-Mansor's vase?"
Flavia asked, as she rose. She was smiling, but
her cheeks were flushed and her serious eyes
caressed her brother. "It was Memory, I think.
And, no, Corrie, the pearls put there cannot be
lost."</p>

<p>The extreme warmth of the day had continued
into the evening. As Isabel followed Flavia across
the hall, Corrie overtook his cousin, wound a
scarf around her bare shoulders and lured her
out on the veranda. She yielded not unwillingly,
contrary to her recent custom of neglecting him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and they disappeared together. Any such latent
project of Gerard's was prevented by Mr. Rose's
mood for chat, a mood not usual for him.</p>

<p>"You are not looking much like the driver I
met on the way home, to-day," he informed his
guest, surveying Gerard quizzically, when they
were established in the drawing-room. "But I
didn't recognize my own son, for that matter. He
don't seem like mine, when he's out in those goblin
clothes driving like Satan in a hurry. It's sensible
enough for you, being in the automobile trade, but
for him it's just fool play."</p>

<p>"He does it a little too well to call it that,"
Gerard returned seriously.</p>

<p>"Yes? Well, I've got money enough to pay
for it&mdash;although it's the most expensive game he's
found yet&mdash;or for anything else he fancies. I've
told him to amuse himself for a while. He is too
young to settle down to work, when there is no
need for it. I never had any playing time, and I
want to see him have his. And he has earned it,
too; I suppose he told you he was through college?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and amazed me."</p>

<p>"He knew it had to be done, so he did it quickly
and without any nonsense. It's an old theory that
given liberty and money, a boy will go to ruin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
I never believed it; I don't yet. And I never
saw why I should make my son a different set of
living rules from those I make for myself. Of
course, I don't mean there was no law in the house;
I don't think I spoiled Corrie. But I've left him
pretty free, only bidding him keep straight. That
I must have, and he knows it. He has got to keep
straight."</p>

<p>A sudden grate like metal on metal roughened
the deliberate speech with a suggestion of grim
inflexibility. Flavia lifted vaguely startled eyes
to her father.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you need to worry about that,"
reassured Gerard smiling. The echo of Corrie's
fresh young tones was in their ears, as he disputed
with his cousin, outside the windows at the end of
the room.</p>

<p>"I guess not. He's too much like his mother."
Mr. Rose dropped his hand on Flavia's, as she
sat in her low chair beside him. "And she was
what they call an aristocrat, nowadays, but I called
a lady when I married her. Old family, gentle
breeding, the society end, and good looks like
my little girl's that seem too fine to touch; she
had all and everything except money. And I gave
her that."</p>

<p>Flavia leaned nearer to her father with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
caressing confidence in mutual affection which
marked all the household intercourse and pervaded
the gorgeous pink villa like an actual fragrance
of atmosphere.</p>

<p>"I gave her that. She liked to spend it. Not,"
his keen eyes suddenly sprang challengingly to the
other man's, "Not that she married me for
money. Don't think it. My wife loved me. I
guess I struck her family like a cyclone; I was
self-made and used to my own way, at thirty, and
not uglier than my neighbors. Mrs. Tom Rose
was a happy woman, until she died, when Corrie
was two years old and Flavia four." He rose
bruskly and crossed the room. "You don't smoke,
Gerard? I always spoil a cigar when I talk."</p>

<p>"I don't unless there's something wrong,"
Gerard answered, tactfully casual. "A cigarette
helps, then. But everything is very right, now.
You know, these races are my holidays, although
they are an important business feature, too. My
factory affairs keep me hard at work most of the
year. Then in the intervals I am designing and
having constructed a genuine racing machine of
my own, much more powerful than the ninety
Mercury I'm driving now. I'm not an idle citizen,
really."</p>

<p>Flavia's head drooped lower. He was telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
her father these things as part of that steady
purpose whose object she felt herself; she knew
it, clairvoyantly acute.</p>

<p>"You get a lot out of living," commented Mr.
Rose, coming back to his seat. "You enjoy it,
I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," Gerard replied candidly. "Why
not?"</p>

<p>"You're right. Now, I want to tell you about
a deal I put through in the Street, to-day."</p>

<p>Flavia moved to the piano and began to touch
the keys. She knew there would be only men's
talk for a while, and from this place she could
watch Gerard unseen. In all the previous days
she had avoided this, refusing to take cognizance
of the physical beauty upon which Isabel dilated,
half-unconsciously defending herself from an undefined
danger. She commenced to play pastel-toned
bits of Nevin and Chaminade, her clear eyes
delighting in free vision.</p>

<p>Out on the veranda, Corrie was sustaining a
defense of his own. Upright against a column,
scarlet with determination, Isabel pursued the wilful
desire she had voiced at the dinner-table.</p>

<p>"That Frenchwoman was around the course
with her husband, yesterday," she urged. "Other
women have done it before. Why won't you take
me?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might get hurt. Father never would let
you."</p>

<p>"He needn't know, stupid. You don't want to,
that's all. I'll ask Mr. Gerard; he'll like to take
me."</p>

<p>The poison had been drawn from that sting,
but Corrie winced, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"I <i>want</i> you, Isabel. I love you."</p>

<p>"You're a boy; I'm a year older than you."</p>

<p>"Eleven months!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I'm a woman. I do what I choose,
while you're afraid to move for fear uncle will
catch you. What would he do, ferule your little
palms?"</p>

<p>Furious, Corrie sprang across and dropped his
hands on her shoulders with the freedom of their
life-long intercourse.</p>

<p>"I'd like to ferule yours," he gritted between
his set teeth. "I'm as much a man as you are a
woman. You haven't any <i>sense</i>. And there's no
use of your dangling after Allan Gerard, for he
don't want you&mdash;he said as much. I'm going in,
and I won't take you around the course."</p>

<p>Gasping, Isabel let him reach the French
windows of the drawing-room before recovering
herself. Then she rushed in pursuit, tripping impatiently
over her long chiffon skirts.</p>

<p>"Corrie&mdash;wait! Corrie!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned sullenly, secretly aghast at his own
temerity. But Isabel laid her hand on his sleeve
without anger.</p>

<p>"You're more man than I thought," she
breathed. "I always liked you better than anyone
else, anyhow. Corrie, if you'd take me around
the course, early in the morning when no one here
knew, I believe you'd be almost grown up enough
to&mdash;to&mdash;be engaged."</p>

<p>"Isabel!" he cried, fire kindling in his face.
"You would? You would?"</p>

<p>"If I get my ride&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He seized her, boy-clumsily, and boy-like lavished
his impetuous kisses.</p>

<p>"You'll get anything," he promised, half-choked
by excitement. "And everything. Oh, Isabel!"</p>

<p>Flavia's delicate music flowed on and on. Before
Mr. Rose had finished his discussion, Corrie
and Isabel entered the room, and the evening ended
without any possibility of Gerard's resuming the
theme commenced in the fountain arcade.</p>

<p>When the group separated for the night, Corrie
detained his sister at the foot of the wide,
gleaming stairs.</p>

<p>"Don't rise early in the morning to give me
my coffee, Other Fellow," he said. "I shan't be
starting for the course at the usual time. I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
been working pretty steadily and I need to rest
for the race itself, day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>She leaned across the bannister to him; the
two young faces framed in young ripples of bright
hair resembled each other very strongly in their
twin moods of exaltation and radiant, half-incredulous
happiness.</p>

<p>"You do not feel unwell, dear? You have not
driven too much?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. But I'm sleepy," he caught a
frond of a tall Madeiran fern that was placed
in its jardiniere on the step opposite him, winding
the satin-green strip over his finger, "honestly, all
in with sleepiness, and I'm going to sleep to-night
as if it was the last quiet night's sleep I'd ever
get. See you to-morrow, kid sister."</p>

<p>"Good-night, dearest."</p>

<p>So, since she was not to give Corrie his morning
coffee, she would not give Gerard's to him
or see him until his return from the race course.
As a matter of course, it was not to be contemplated
that she should rise at dawn for a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
breakfast with the guest, at this period when
all the fine elements that composed their relation
hesitated at the point of crystallization. But she
scarcely regretted the postponed interview. It
would be better to meet each other differently, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
more leisure. He would come again to the fountain
arcade, where she watched for Corrie's return.</p>

<p>When Flavia reached her own room, there stood
on her dressing-table a long silver-paper and filigree
box. Wondering, she raised the lid, to be
met with a gust of exquisite perfume and confronted
with a mass of frail yellow roses, lovely
with the quaint, virginal beauty of suggestion that
separates them from all their other-colored kin.
Across the glistening petals lay a cover cut from
a pocket dictionary, bearing written upon it one
sentence: "Definition of the meaning of Flavia
Rose."</p>

<p>She laid her head beside the flowers, gold upon
gold. She, also, the fancy came to her, had placed
this day in the vase of Al-Mansor. But the day
to come outshone it, as a rosy pearl one merely
white.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," she whispered to herself. "To-morrow."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>VI</h2>
<h3>WRECK</h3>

<p>Gray, sluggish, slow in coming and sullen of
aspect, a reluctant dawn succeeded the night. A
wet mist clung everywhere in the windless atmosphere,
muffling sound as well as light. There
was not even a servant stirring in the Rose house,
when Gerard descended the dark stairs and went
out into the chill, damp park.</p>

<p>In the garage one bright point shone out; under
a swinging electric lamp Rupert was preparing
his machine to go out, a solitary figure in the
expanse of wavering shadows and dim bulks.</p>

<p>"Where are Rose and his man?" Gerard questioned,
as he came across the floor.</p>

<p>His voice rolled startlingly loud in the lofty,
echoing room. Moving to reply, the mechanician
let fall a tool and the crash repeated itself sharply
from every stone arch and angle.</p>

<p>"Rose won't be out at the course till late; I
guess our peaceful life ain't what he's used to,
exactly. He 'phoned over last night to Dean,
who's sleeping yet."</p>

<p>Gerard nodded, eyeing the Mercury racer with
affectionate attention.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, is she?" he asked.</p>

<p>Rupert straightened himself and proceeded to
close the hood.</p>

<p>"I ain't supposing we'll need to be towed," he
conceded sarcastically. "But I'll put in a rope,
if you're worried bad, and take my copy of <i>Motor
Repairing at a Glance</i>."</p>

<p>"Do," Gerard urged. "I'd like to have it
found on you, Rupert. Start her up, then, if
you're ready."</p>

<p>He crossed, with the last word, to the shelf
where lay his racing mask and gauntlets. The
melancholy drip from moist eaves and trees, the
dreary half-light and heavy air had absolutely no
depressing power upon his flawless nerves and
vigor of life. By the open door he paused to
look out, unconsciously clasping his hands behind
his head with the leisurely grace and relaxation of
one who found pleasure in mere movement.</p>

<p>"There'll be a wet course," Rupert's muffled
tones came from the opposite end of the room.</p>

<p>"Well?" Gerard queried lazily. "What of
it?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Instead sounded the
click of moving throttle and spark, and the place
burst into thunderous tumult; violet flames darted
from the exhausts and enfolded the hood of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
vibrating car as it moved forward to its master's
side.</p>

<p>"I don't like this morning, and I don't like
this course," stated Rupert, sombrely definite,
through the roar and rattle of irregular reports
from the cut-down motor. "But I guess I've got
to stand for them. Anyhow, I couldn't have a
classier Friday-the-thirteenth emotion equipment
if I had been to a voodoo fortune teller who had a
grudge against me. What are we waiting for?"</p>

<p>Gerard lingered in taking his seat, his amazed
eyes travelling over the small, discontented dark
face of his companion.</p>

<p>"Something's wrong, Rupert?"</p>

<p>"I ain't saying so&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>The driver's own expression shadowed slightly;
he looked again and more searchingly at the other.
In common with most men who had lived in the
tense atmosphere of the most dangerous form of
racing yet evolved, he had witnessed more than
one case where a presentiment did not fail of fulfilment.
Irrespective of whether catalogued as
coincidence, occult foresight or absurdity, the
facts did exist, occasionally to be read in the
prosaic columns of a newspaper, more often lost
except in camp annals. He knew, and Rupert
knew, of a mechanician who suddenly refused ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>solutely
to go out with the driver by whose side
he had ridden countless miles, having no better
reason than a disinclination for the trip. And
they both had seen the substitute who took his
place brought in dead, an hour later, after his
car's wreck. A widely-known victor of many
races, one of Gerard's close friends, had come to
shake hands with him in a state of causeless
nervousness that would have shamed a novice, just
before starting on the ride from which he never
returned. The price of debate is too high to argue
with some things; Gerard temporized.</p>

<p>"I don't want to take you out feeling like that.
Give yourself a day off," he suggested. "I'll
find one of the factory men to go out with me
for the morning's practice."</p>

<p>"Who's crazy now?" inquired his mechanician
acidly, and flung himself back in his narrow seat.</p>

<p>The Mercury slipped through Mr. Rose's winding
drives, plunged into the sandy Long Island
road, and sped lurching toward the course.</p>

<p>There was nothing dull or depressing about the
starting point, at the Motor Parkway. Before
the busy row of repair pits throbbed and panted
some of the cars, surrounded by their force of
workers; in other camps the men stood, watch in
hand, timing the machines already out. Reporters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
vibrated everywhere; surrounded by an admiring
group, two world-famous French and Italian
drivers were pitching pennies for the last cigarettes
from a box of special brand. Only the tiers
of empty seats in the grand-stand and the absence
of spectators in fields and parking-spaces distinguished
this practice morning from the actual
race.</p>

<p>There was a general movement of greeting as
the Mercury rolled in and Gerard sprang out at
his own camp.</p>

<p>"Where's your pink pet, Allan?" called a
driver, from the starting line. "What's up&mdash;mornin'
air too crude for millionaire kids?"</p>

<p>"He <i>isn't</i> up," was the blithe reply. "Never
mind Rose, he's coming; tell me where you got
your five-cylinder machine, Jack."</p>

<p>"A late Rose, eh? Oh, I've got six cylinders
here, all right, but I daren't run on all of them
now for fear my speed would make the rest of
you quit, discouraged. I'm goin' to make your
yesterday's record look like a last year's timetable,
this mornin'."</p>

<p>"You look out that you don't break your neck.
Rupert says it's a hoodoo day. We don't want
you in the hospital twice this season."</p>

<p>"Is Rupert sad?" questioned the big blonde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
pilot of the neighboring camp, leaning over the
railing.</p>

<p>"I ain't been so near it since I put my foot
in a hole and sprained my ankle ten minutes before
the start, when I was racing with Darling French
at Philadelphia," admitted the mechanician. "It
hurt me fierce."</p>

<p>"Your ankle?"</p>

<p>"No, seeing him start without me."</p>

<p>"Say, Gerard, there's your pink Rambler," a
distant voice signified.</p>

<p>About to send his car forward, Gerard paused
to glance over his shoulder, and caught the pink
flash behind a row of mist-draped trees edging the
cross-road. Sudden mischief curved his lips, his
amber eyes laughed behind their goggles.</p>

<p>"Tell Corrie Rose I'll give him that game of
auto tag, if he happens along while I'm on a
straight stretch," he called across to one of Corrie's
men, by way of farewell.</p>

<p>A little breeze stirred the mist, as the Mercury
shot down the course; the gray light was brightening
by slow gradations.</p>

<p>There was small probability that Gerard's car
and the rose-colored machine would soon find themselves
together on the twelve-mile circuit, allowing
for their difference in starting time. But as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Mercury turned into the straight stretch of back
road, on the second time around, there sounded a
sharp report, the car staggered perilously, and a
tire tore itself loose from a rear wheel to hurtle,
a vicious projectile of rubber and steel, far across
the stubble fields. Reeling, but held to its course
by the driver's trained hand, the Mercury slackened
its flight and was brought to a stop. Rupert
was already leaning over the back, dragging free
a spare tire; Gerard slipped out of his seat.</p>

<p>For experts the task was not long. A white
car thundered past the workers, leaving a swirl
of dust and flying pebbles, its mechanician turning
to survey the halted Mercury. As Rupert swept
the last tool into its place with precise swiftness,
the throbbing of a second motor drifted to them,
a pink streak darted around a distant curve.</p>

<p>"It's Corrie," identified Gerard. "Get in,
Rupert. If he wasn't forced by his money into
the amateur ranks, that boy would make some
of us work to keep our laurels, all right."</p>

<p>The panther-agile figure swung into place beside
him.</p>

<p>"I ain't a market gardener," Rupert drawled,
fitting one small foot in a strap support, as the
car leaped forward. "But I guess those plants
ain't apt to flourish in too rich soil."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mercury did not gather speed too rapidly,
rather it lingered until the pink car bore close
down upon it.</p>

<p>"How near?" suddenly demanded Gerard,
above the noise of the motor.</p>

<p>The mechanician reconnoitred.</p>

<p>"Hundred feet," he made report.</p>

<p>"Wave to him."</p>

<p>Rupert raised his hand obediently. The Mercury
sprang ahead under Gerard's touch, and with
an answering roar the rose-colored machine sped
in pursuit.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Corrie understood
the play; nor that his car was easily capable of
passing the sixty-mile an hour gait now held by
the Mercury. But he was not allowed to pass.
Each time he essayed it, the other racer swerved
in front and cut off the road.</p>

<p>It was as dangerous a game as could well be
designed, had either driver been less skilled, but
it was safe enough now. Gerard was laughing as
he drove, when the first tiny missile rattled against
his car.</p>

<p>"He's pitching spare bolts," shouted Rupert,
at his companion's ear, himself grimly amused.
"Peevish, ain't he?"</p>

<p>Gerard nodded, and crossed the narrow road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
with an unexpected turn that drew a baffled explosion
from the checked car behind. A brass
nut smacked the Mercury's gasoline tank. It was
not difficult to imagine Corrie's excited tempest of
defeat, to those who knew him.</p>

<p>"The turn's ahead&mdash;we'll call it off there,"
Gerard answered mirthfully. "Give her some oil."</p>

<p>The two cars were rushing down the last half-mile
of straight road. Rupert was stooping to
reach the oil pump when the pink car made its
final attempt to pass and was again forced back,
but across his outstretched arm he glanced up to
Gerard, and glimpsed the last flying missile as it
came.</p>

<p>"<i>Duck!</i>" he shouted harshly, "Look out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was no time for action. As Gerard turned
his head, the heavy steel wrench struck him below
the right temple. Even Rupert's swiftness was
too slow; the driver fell forward across his steering-wheel
before the mechanician could snatch it
from the inert grasp. With a lurch the speeding
Mercury caught in a rut, swerved from the
road and, leaping a yard-high embankment,
crashed through a row of trees to roll over and
over like a broken toy, scattering splintered wreckage
over the farmhouse enclosure beyond.</p>

<p>The light breeze of half an hour earlier had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
freshened and gained strength, the pale-gray sky
was changing to delicate blue. When the horrified
knot of reporters and motor enthusiasts from the
nearby Westbury corner swarmed into the orchard
to join the pale-faced farmer already there, the
sun emerged brilliantly from a bank of clouds,
glinting across the heap of twisted metal and the
still figure that lay beneath it, illumining the
dishevelled, gasping mechanician who struggled
dizzily to rise from where he had been flung to
safety, fifty feet from the wreck.</p>

<p>It is difficult for any group of men, however
willing, to work without a leader. While the
inexperienced rescuers stood hesitating on the
verge of action, Corrie Rose in his pink racing
costume sprang up the bank, his blue eyes burning
in his white face, his lips stained with blood
where his teeth had bitten through.</p>

<p>"Get those logs, over there," he commanded
savagely. "The car's got to be jacked up. Hurry
up&mdash;do you want him to die under there? <i>Jump!</i>"</p>

<p>His fiery energy ran through the men with a
vivifying shock. Torpor transformed to animation,
the grim work was attacked. Under Corrie's
brief orders they scattered in search of the logs,
a telephone, and such aid as the place afforded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
The farmer's wife assumed charge of the semi-conscious
Rupert, for whom no one else had time.</p>

<p>Into the prim, staid country parlor they carried
Gerard, fifteen minutes later, and laid him
on a horse-hair couch under a square-framed lithograph
of <i>The Trial of John Knox</i>. A plush
photograph album was jostled on its marble table
by the driver's shattered mask and a glove upon
whose wrist still clung and ticked his miniature
watch, the flowered carpet was trampled under the
heedless feet and streaked with dull red here and
there.</p>

<p>"They stopped here yesterday for some water,"
sobbed the mistress of the house hysterically.
"Oh dear, dear! Pitching apples across the yard
at the little dark one, he was, and both of them
making fun."</p>

<p>The rattling explosions of a motor cycle sounded
from without; the first of the emergency surgeons
to arrive ran up the steps and into the room,
stripping off his coat while appraising with keen
eyes the unconscious patient.</p>

<p>"Get out, everyone," he directed concisely.
"Here, I want a helper&mdash;you, Rose?"</p>

<p>Corrie, on his knee beside the couch, looked up
and dragged himself erect. Gerard's face was no
more drawn and colorless than his, but he an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>swered
to the call, as half an hour before he had
answered the demand of the situation for a guide.</p>

<p>"I'll help," he consented, his voice hoarse. "I
deserve it."</p>

<p>Before the surgeon's imperious gesture, the rest
of the men were retreating to leave the room, when
those nearest the door were suddenly thrust back.
Staggering, furious passion blazing in his
scratched and pain-twisted face, Rupert burst
across the threshold.</p>

<p>"Alive?" he hurled the fierce question. "Alive?
What?"</p>

<p>"Yes," snapped the surgeon. "Cut this sleeve,
Rose&mdash;gently! Clear out, you; the ambulance
men will take care of you when they get here."</p>

<p>Rupert's haggard black eyes embraced the
scene, and encountered Corrie.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;&mdash;" he snarled, choking, and whirled to
face the witnesses, extending one slim shaking
hand toward the workers beside the couch. "Here,
I ain't supposing but that most of you are chasing
headlines for paper rags&mdash;print down that Allan
Gerard was killed by that man. I'm saying it;
Gerard cut him off from getting past, and he
pitched a wrench that knocked him out. Go down
to the course and you'll get the wrench to Mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>souri
you, on the road. Rose knocked out Gerard
and our car ran wild."</p>

<p>The concentrated vehemence and force of the
arraignment stupefied even the reportorial instinct.
Dazed, the hearers stared from the
mechanician's tattered, accusing figure to the pale
young driver who offered neither surprise nor defense,
but went steadily on with his unsteadying task.</p>

<p>"He wrecked us&mdash;&mdash;" Rupert made a limping
step forward. "Well? Did you guess I was
reciting this to put you to sleep? Why ain't you
taking him out of here? Put <i>his</i> mechanician
through the third degree and get his story&mdash;who
nailed you fast here? Why don't you <i>move</i>?"</p>

<p>The scissors slipped tinkling to the floor from
Corrie's grasp. Livid with wrath, the surgeon
stood up.</p>

<p>"Get out, all, and take that maniac with you,"
he stormed. "Not a word; I don't care if Rose
has murdered all Long Island, he's some use now.
Clear out and leave this room quiet. Quick."</p>

<p>He was obeyed, the nearest men drawing Rupert
into the retiring group, and the door closed.</p>

<p>Outside, the reporters became themselves.
While ambulances dashed up, motor cycles, official
cars and private vehicles arrived to halt around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the little house, the Mercury's mechanician was
hurried apart and his story coaxed from him in
detail.</p>

<p>The last automobile to come up, an hour after
the accident, was a gilt-monogramed foreign
limousine. From it descended a gentleman who,
after a comprehensive glance over the disordered,
crowded orchard, crossed straight to where Rupert
sat hunched on a kitchen chair opposite the shattered
car.</p>

<p>"Rupert," he appealed, catching the mechanician's
shoulder. "Rupert, what's been happening
here?"</p>

<p>Very deliberately Rupert lifted his dark face,
its grimness not lessened by flecks and bars of
court-plaster; across the apathy of physical
exhaustion his black eyes gleamed vivid, hard
resolve.</p>

<p>"Your son's finished Gerard, Mr. Rose," he
stated, monotonously explicit. "He slipped his
temper and fired a wrench at Gerard for not
giving him the road. It hit him, and we ran
wild without a driver till we struck here. Ask
him&mdash;he's in there with what's left of Gerard&mdash;why
he's sent Dean where he ain't to be found,
if I'm lying."</p>

<p>Mr. Rose released Rupert's shoulder, both men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
equally oblivious of the pain his grasp had inflicted
on bruised flesh and muscle, and turned his
gray face to the surrounding group in dumb quest
of confirmation. Then, moving stiffly, he walked
toward the house.</p>

<p>There was an authority in his bearing that
gained him unopposed entrance. In the hall,
nauseating with the ominous odor of antiseptics,
he was met by one of the doctors.</p>

<p>"You can turn my house into a hospital," Mr.
Rose said briefly. "I want Gerard taken there
instead of to your places. You can have all the
money you like."</p>

<p>The man looked at the card presented, his professional
impassivity flickering, but shook his
head.</p>

<p>"He would better not be moved at all, sir;
at least, not to-day. He can be asked, if you
wish."</p>

<p>"He is conscious, then?"</p>

<p>"Just about," he shrugged, reaching for the
door. "Here, if you care to go in."</p>

<p>The room was glaring with light, the lace curtains
were dragged wide apart from the windows
and the shades rolled high. Idle now in the
presence of more skilled attendants, but recognized
as one who had earned the right to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
there, Corrie stood near the foot of the improvised
bed, leaning against the wall with his fair head
slightly bent. At the sound of the door he turned
that way, as Mr. Rose stopped on the threshold.</p>

<p>The snapping latch, or some more subtle influence,
aroused someone else. Slowly Gerard's heavy
lashes lifted, and he saw father and son looking
at each other across the parlor strewn with the
tragic litter of the last hour's work. There was
nothing to interrupt the triple regard; it endured
long, with steadfast intensity.</p>

<p>In a corner two surgeons were holding a subdued
consultation, a third was busied at the marble
table, the attention of all fully engaged.</p>

<p>"Put a pillow under my head, someone," suddenly
bade the shadow of Allan Gerard's voice,
across the hush. "And give me a cigarette."</p>

<p>There was a startled flurry in the room. Familiar
enough with the last request from his masculine
patients, the man at the table took a case
from his own pocket and, lighting one of the
cigarettes, stooped over the bed.</p>

<p>"Keep your grip on yourself," he approved
brusquely. "But don't move."</p>

<p>It was in his left hand that Gerard took the
tiny narcotic, his right arm and shoulder were a
mere bulk of splints and linen bandages.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks," his difficult voice spoke again.
"Now open that door and let everyone in&mdash;I want
to talk to them."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gerard!"</p>

<p>His clear eyes, dark with suffering but absolutely
collected, met the surgeon's.</p>

<p>"I've got to talk to them, doctor, and I may
be out of my head or in a box, to-morrow. Let
them in&mdash;the reporters, I mean."</p>

<p>The listeners gazed at each other, a shock ran
through the group. Every man there knew
Rupert's story of the accident, every man guessed
that it was Gerard's own version that was to be
given now. Someone offered Mr. Rose one of the
horse-hair chairs, during the moment of rearrangement
before the youngest of the doctors
left the room. Only Corrie remained unmoved, not
changing his position or looking at Gerard. There
was a certain dignity of utter quiescence in his
pose that comprehended neither defiance nor submission,
but a strange, aloof patience.</p>

<p>The representative reporters from the city
journals filed in, avidly expectant. With them
came two officials of the racing association, and
a metallic-eyed man whose plain clothes were contradicted
by the badge visible under his coat.
There was silent orderliness; the grim significance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
of the room, the presence of the watchful surgeons,
the central figure of the driver so well known to
all of those who entered, were subduing to the
least sensitive. Nor was the effect less hushing
because of that other driver who attended in the
background, the strong sunlight shining on his
glistening pink garb and still face.</p>

<p>Gerard let fall the hand holding the cigarette,
when the company was complete, and slowly turned
his brown head on the pillow to face them.</p>

<p>"You newspaper men have been first-class to
me for a good while; it's my chance to reciprocate
now," he asserted. "Well, I'll give what copy I
can. I know you want it, boys&mdash;you've often been
after me for less."</p>

<p>The familiar gayety rippled above his aching
effort of speech, his will locked to composure each
rebellious line of expression. No one stirred in
the room.</p>

<p>"I wish it were a better yarn. But when two
tires blow out at the same time, while a car's
turning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This time, there was a general sigh of quick-drawn
breath. Mr. Rose stood up.</p>

<p>"When two tires let go, at ninety miles an
hour, there's apt to be a wreck. I&mdash;&mdash;" his lashes
fell wearily. "I couldn't hold the machine to the
road. The shock broke my control&mdash;there's no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
one to blame but me&mdash;&mdash;" The cigarette crumpled
in his clenching fingers, his straight brows knotted.</p>

<p>"Gerard," burst forth the racing official, excitedly
urgent in his suspense. "Your tires
wrecked you? That's your last word? Gerard,
if you can speak, do!"</p>

<p>The amber eyes re-opened in answer, to meet
the fixed gaze of the eager men who waited opposite.</p>

<p>"Yes," gasped Gerard, casually definite.
"What else? Corrie, leave me your smokes,
they're a better brand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>If there had been any doubt left the witnesses,
that comrade request beat it down. The surgeon
flung out his hand in a sweeping gesture of dismissal,
as he sprang toward his fainting patient.
Gerard had finished.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose went out with the other men. Some
of his florid color had come back, he walked
more firmly and his face had relaxed to naturalness.
On the narrow porch the referee from the
racing association held out his hand with frank
congratulation.</p>

<p>"Glad poor Gerard set matters right before
they got any further, Mr. Rose. It sounded
nasty, for a while. The mechanician struck his
head in the upset, I fancy; I've seen a man run
half a mile across country, crazy as a loon, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
being pitched out on his head in a sand-bank.
They'd better get Jack Rupert into bed and
keep him quiet; he'll wake up to-morrow sane as
ever. Nice way your son took it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Corwin B. is straight," declared Mr. Rose,
proudly self-contained in his relief. "I guess
there wasn't much need to worry about that part.
I'll wait here and take him home with me, now;
he's had about all of that room he ought to stand,
fond of Gerard as he is."</p>

<p>"He looked done up, yes. Well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A long shout sounded down the course, a clamor
of excited speech. A troup of men appeared,
running toward the house in the wake of a chauffeur
who held up some object that glittered in
the sun.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" the leader called ahead. "I've
got it where he said, beside the road!"</p>

<p>The thing in his hand was a small, heavy nickel
wrench. The men on the porch and the men in
the yard stared at each other, mute. After a
moment Mr. Rose drew out his handkerchief,
passed it across his forehead and lips, then went
down to his limousine, got in and sank back against
the cushions.</p>

<p>"Home," he issued his order.</p>

<p>"Mr. Corwin is not coming, sir?"</p>

<p>"Home."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>VII</h2>
<h3>"THE GREATEST OF THESE"</h3>

<p>It was nearly two hours after the Mercury
car had crashed into ruin under the aromatic
apple-trees, before knowledge of the disaster came
to Flavia. Breakfast was over, at least the breakfast
of Mr. Rose and his daughter; no other
member of the family had appeared. A maid
reported that Isabel had ordered her horse and
had departed on an early ride to the neighboring
golf club, where she was engaged to play with an
equally athletic college girl, that morning. There
was nothing to disturb the customary pleasant
routine or to suggest uneasiness. At the usual
hour Mr. Rose left for the city; he was on his
way to New York when he first caught the rumor
that sent him instead to the farmhouse at Westbury.</p>

<p>Flavia, roseate, softly irradiated, moving in an
atmosphere of undefined expectation as difficult
to breathe calmly as the rarefied air of a mountain-top,
had held herself to the accomplishment
of her daily charges. She was seated at her little
white-and-gold desk in her white-and-gold study,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
setting the household affairs in order for the
day with the dainty precision of all her methods,
when Isabel came into the room and stopped upright
and rigid, near the door.</p>

<p>"You had better hear it now," the younger
girl dully announced. "There has been an
accident on the course."</p>

<p>Flavia's hands flew over her heart, the room
blackened.</p>

<p>"Corrie&mdash;&mdash;" she gasped.</p>

<p>"No; Mr. Gerard. He is alive, that's all I
know."</p>

<p>The scent of the yellow roses Flavia had put
in her hair dilated to a stifling heaviness that
hindered breath; she covered her eyes with her
small cold fingers, seeking the dark, mute under
torture. He was alive&mdash;that niggard concession
was made to Allan Gerard, whose rich fullness
of vigor and dominant presence last night had
seemed the one firm reality in a world of pleasant
vagueness. Weak, conscious of nothing but what
her inward vision showed, she lay in her chair;
questioning no more, making no sign.</p>

<p>Suddenly Isabel, the self-assured, evenly poised
Isabel, was on the floor at her cousin's knees, burying
her face in Flavia's pale-yellow dress and
sobbing in frantic hysteria.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Flavia, Flavia, I can't bear it! I am afraid,
I am afraid&mdash;if he should die&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shocked back into strength, Flavia bent over
her, soothing and caressing with soft touches and
inarticulate phrases of affection.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear, hush! Put your head here. Let
me call Martha; you frighten me, Isabel!"</p>

<p>The tempest did not last long. As abruptly as
she had lost self-command, Isabel regained it.
Rising to her feet, she swept back the disordered
auburn curls from her flushed face and stood silent
beside the desk, in a state approaching exhaustion.
She was wearing a dark riding-habit soiled with
dust and stained in several places with oil or
grease, her high-laced boots were scratched and
sand-covered. But Flavia was beyond notice of
costume and saw only her cousin's sullen misery
of expression.</p>

<p>"Dear, you loved him," escaped her, in her
double compassion for the woman whom Gerard
had not chosen.</p>

<p>Isabel's gray eyes were crossed by a spark.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I <i>hate</i> him!" she flared viciously.
"What did he do it for? He had no right. He,
he&mdash;&mdash;" She pressed her drenched handkerchief
hard against her lips. "Corrie, poor Corrie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Flavia shrank, commencing to tremble before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a looming premonition of something still worse
to be endured.</p>

<p>"What of Corrie? Isabel, what?"</p>

<p>"You will hear soon enough," she assured bitterly.
"I've said all I can. No&mdash;don't ask me,
don't follow me. They will tell you downstairs.
I'm going."</p>

<p>Downstairs, meant the servants. Flavia Rose
was, above all things, maiden-proud; as Gerard's
fianc&eacute;e, as Gerard's wife, no cost of pain or
humiliation would have kept her from him. But
she was neither. She had only her own interpretation
of his mirthful glances and graceful
speech, only a few yellow roses to hint that he
did not regard her as the most casual of friends.
Suppose she had been mistaken, suppose he had
meant only courtesy to a hostess whose youth
exacted gallantry?</p>

<p>Isabel had gone. Flavia turned her face to
a diminutive mirror lying among the trifles on
her desk. Could she go down to the curious
servants so&mdash;pale, quivering and emotion-spent?
Even as she looked into her own reflected eyes,
the tears at last overflowed.</p>

<p>It was half an hour later before Flavia, quiet,
dignified and only betrayed by her absolute pallor,
trusted herself to descend the stairs.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rose house was too near the race course,
too intimately concerned in the drama, for the
information she sought not to be already rife
gossip there. When Mr. Rose came home, near
noon, he had little left to tell his daughter except
Gerard's condition and his defense of Corrie.</p>

<p>"Then Corrie did not hurt him," she grasped
the exquisite relief.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose shook his head, reluctantly discouraged
and discouraging. He had not gone to the
city during those intervening hours; he never,
then or afterward, spoke of where he had been or
what he had felt.</p>

<p>"There was the wrench," he heavily reminded
her. "And where has he sent Dean, who must
have seen all that happened and could have given
Gerard's mechanician the lie? I've not seen Corrie
except across the room," the recollection of
that ghastly room broke the speech. "We have
got to wait until he comes home to answer."</p>

<p>Flavia slipped her hand into his, nestling to
him, and he put his arm about her. Both were
remembering Corrie's brief, simoon-hot tempers,
his hasty tongue and ready hand&mdash;and swift repentances.
Had an occasion come when the repentance
was too late, too vain! And what repentance!
To the sister who knew with life-long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
knowledge the ardent, passionate Corrie, his young
rigidity in honor and high pride, his tenacious
affections, this menaced downfall was almost as
appalling as his death. She thrust the possibility
from her with revolted condemnation of herself
for crediting this libel, this slander of her brother.
What had he ever done to justify such a belief?</p>

<p>"Papa, he could not!" she defended. "Corrie
could not. Not, not <i>Corrie</i>!"</p>

<p>"I hope not, my girl."</p>

<p>Something in his tone, some quality she did
not recognize, brought her gaze to his face with
a fresh dread. What would it mean to Thomas
Rose, if this were true of his son? And what
would the change in Thomas Rose mean to Corrie?</p>

<p>The early autumn dusk had fallen and the lamps
were lit, when Corrie came home. The routine
of the household had gone on through the long
day; under the eye of convention, Flavia and
Mr. Rose had dressed for dinner and now sat together
in the drawing-room, each holding an unread
book. But at the closing of the outer door
both started erect, pretense forgotten.</p>

<p>"Corrie!" his father summoned. Not Corwin
B.; by a trick of usage the nickname had become
formal, the formal name a playfulness not to be
spoken now.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Corrie came quietly between the velvet curtains.
He still wore the pink racing costume,
its hue in marked contrast to his worn young
face. That one day had drawn white lines about
his boyish mouth and set black circles under his
blue eyes. As if feeling himself on trial, he stopped
just within the room and stood with the quiescent
endurance that he had shown in the farmhouse
parlor and which sat so strangely upon him.</p>

<p>"First&mdash;Gerard?" required Mr. Rose hardly.
"You've been there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. They say he will live."</p>

<p>"Live! What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They say he will never drive again."</p>

<p>Flavia cried out faintly, grasping the arms of
her chair, and there was a pause.</p>

<p>"I've heard Rupert's story, and I've heard
Gerard's," slowly pronounced Mr. Rose. "I
haven't heard yours, yet. Nor I haven't learned
that anyone has. What wrecked Gerard's car?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Corrie's breathing quickened
slightly, but he neither moved nor spoke,
nor lifted his eyes to the two who watched him.
After moments, Mr. Rose put out his hand and
pushed away a tinted electric lamp from which
the light fell too strongly on his face.</p>

<p>"Rupert isn't lying," he asserted. "He might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
be crazy. If he is, say so. I saw your nickel
wrench picked up, myself, and a dozen people
along the line saw you and Gerard racing just
before the smash. Where is your mechanician,
Dean? What has he got to say? It looks bad,
your hiding him."</p>

<p>"He was not with me," Corrie replied, his voice
oddly smothered.</p>

<p>"Not with you? Rupert talks of seeing him
beside you in the car."</p>

<p>"Rupert is mistaken. Dean was not yet out
at the course and I started alone. Ask the men
at my camp and the race officials; they will tell
you that I took out my machine without a mechanician."</p>

<p>"Then Rupert is crazy? Gerard told the
truth? Speak out! Are you afraid or sulky?"</p>

<p>This time the lash took effect. Corrie moved
sharply and spoke.</p>

<p>"I am not going to talk," he declared definitely.
"Nor ought you to ask it of me, sir. If you
don't know how I loved Allan Gerard, if you can't
feel that I would rather have killed myself than
hurt him and would have turned my car against
a stone wall sooner than see to-day, there is no
use of my saying it. I don't care what anyone
thinks or says. I stood the worst that can come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to me when I helped his surgeons to-day and heard
him clear me&mdash;&mdash;I'm going to my room; you
needn't fear I'll run away."</p>

<p>Mr. Rose was across the room before his son
could leave it, gripping the satin-clad shoulder.</p>

<p>"You'll keep what Gerard lied to give you,"
he promised with inexorable menace. "And that's
what is left of your reputation. You'll neither
run nor skulk in your room; you'll go dress
for dinner and come down here and eat it. We'll
have no scenes. The medicine you have got to
take is nothing to the black dose Gerard has to
swallow."</p>

<p>"Papa!" Flavia appealed, unheard.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Corrie answered simply.</p>

<p>On the wide landing of the staircase Flavia
overtook her brother. There was just one thing
she could say to him, must and would always
have to say whatever his faults or the rest of
the world's condemnation.</p>

<p>"I love you," she panted, clasping her little
hands around his arm. "Corrie, it is hurting you
so! I love you, let me come."</p>

<p>Under the soft hall-lights he turned to her,
blue eyes meeting blue eyes; then for the first
time in their lives he took her in his arms with
a man's touch and kissed her.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"You stick close, Other Fellow," he said unsteadily.
"I'm pretty lonesome; you're a help.
But don't come now."</p>

<p>Pretty lonesome. Yes, that expressed the
atmosphere of aloofness, the air of being suddenly
walled around and set apart, that now marked the
impulsive and social Corrie. It was with him
when he came down to the dreary dinner, an
hour later.</p>

<p>The one who failed to play out the wretched
farce of customary life was Isabel. She kept
her room, alleging illness, and did not appear
to lend aid to the evening which the three spent
in silent endurance of one another and their own
thoughts. The very surroundings insisted on the
image of Gerard; a book he had been reading
lay open on the table, the music he preferred was
waiting on the piano rack. At nine o'clock, unable
to bear more, Flavia rose, hurriedly pleading fatigue.
Corrie also rose with her to retire,
or to escape.</p>

<p>"Wait," his father bade, at his movement, laying
down a newspaper. "You will not be out
with your automobile, to-morrow."</p>

<p>Corrie looked at him without rebellion or surprise,
unflinching from the decision.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall never drive a racing car again, sir,"
was his quiet statement.</p>

<p>And only Gerard could have gauged what that
renunciation cost his fellow-driver.</p>

<p>Gerard, at that hour, was not conscious of many
things. The night that was long at the rose-colored
villa, was longer yet in the little farmhouse.
But when the first pale light of dawn
made the parlor windows grow into glimmering
squares of gray, the patient suddenly spoke out
of what was rather stupor than sleep.</p>

<p>"'And the greatest of these is charity?'" he
said strongly and clearly.</p>

<p>The nurse hurried to his side, but it was many
moments before he again aroused and asked for
Rupert.</p>

<p>"Now, and alone," he insisted, when she demurred,
urging rest.</p>

<p>Even in his helplessness he was compelling. The
nurse went in search of Rupert, who had kept
vigil in the kitchen, scoffing at the suggestion of
bed while that battle was being waged in the other
room.</p>

<p>Gerard turned his fever-burnished eyes upon
his small mechanician's sullen face, when that
visitor entered. Both men understood perfectly
well the contest of wills about to ensue. Both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
were coolly determined and prepared with the fine
weapon of mutual knowledge of one another.</p>

<p>"There's a silver case on the table; get me a
cigarette and light it, will you?" requested Gerard,
in his low, unsure voice.</p>

<p>Rupert complied. He had not altogether escaped,
himself, with mere scratches; he limped as
he came across to place the cigarette in the languid
fingers.</p>

<p>"I guess there ain't any special need to ask
if it's hurting bad, when you're wanting these
dopes," he drew grim inference. "Here."</p>

<p>"It is, all the time. Thanks. I didn't bring
you here to talk about that, when you should be
asleep, though. Rupert, no more is to be said
about Corrie Rose. There has been too much
of that already, I can see."</p>

<p>Rupert's black eyes hardened and narrowed to
lines of glinting jet.</p>

<p>"I've got the truth stripped down to running
facts, carrying no trimmings, and I'm demonstrating
it to everybody I meet," he imparted dryly.
"And I mean to keep on. I know what you want,
all right, and I ain't intending to do it. Let him
stand for what is coming to him."</p>

<p>Gerard lifted his cigarette, seeking the narcotic
smoke. His superb vitality and undrained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
youth had turned upon him like traitorous servants
upon a fallen master, denying him surcease in
unconsciousness and holding him as a sensitive
instrument for pain to run its gamut upon.</p>

<p>"Why?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Because I want to see him get his. You
don't? I do. I guess my say goes, this time.
I ain't enjoying being sore wherever I ain't worse,
but I'd go out and take another smash like we had
to-day to see him wearing zebra clothes in a jail.
Missing that, I'll make that pink millionaire palace
red-hot and get him ruled off every race course
in the country."</p>

<p>"Rupert&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The mechanician's gesture cut off protest.</p>

<p>"There ain't any use! I mean it."</p>

<p>"You liked Corrie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I ain't noticing it, now. When you were behind
the steering-wheel, your say so was what
happened&mdash;if you'd said to light the gasoline tank,
I'd have struck a match. That's business. This
ain't. Rose stands for what he did, for I'm free
to put it through."</p>

<p>"Very true; I am helpless," Gerard acquiesced,
his white lips compressed, and averted his head on
the pillow.</p>

<p>Checked, Rupert stared at the other with many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
shifting expressions twitching his own angry dark
face.</p>

<p>"Do you know what the doctors say?" he
demanded, at last. "Are you knowing, when
you ask me to let Rose off, what he's done to
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>There was no retort to that all-sufficient brevity.
None was attempted.</p>

<p>The windows had gradually paled from gray to
white, streaks of gold caught and reflected in the
glass panes as the sun drew up above the horizon.
All night the air had been filled with a steady
murmur and dull flow of sound, unobserved because
of its very continuity. Now, across the
hush of the sick room unexpectedly crashed a
roar of rapid explosions, growing thunderous as
it approached nearer; cheers of joyous excitement
pealed from many throats. Gerard started,
his eyes blazing wide.</p>

<p>"The race," flung the mechanician bitterly.
"It's on."</p>

<p>Gerard slowly raised his left arm and dropped
it across his face as those who yesterday were
his mates rushed past the house. With the movement
a spot of crimson sprang into view against
the linen swathing his shoulder, enlarging omi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>nously,
but even the alarmed Rupert knew this was
no time to summon doctor or nurse, whatever the
physical cost.</p>

<p>"Don't you think?" Gerard presently asked,
quite gently and naturally, "that I've got enough
to stand, Rupert?"</p>

<p>The sound that broke from the vanquished
mechanician was less cry than curse.</p>

<p>"I'll shut up!" he cast his submission before
the victor. "I ain't going to lie&mdash;I'd choke&mdash;but
I'll hold my tongue. Don't ask more or I'll take
back that. You've got me down; I'll shut up."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>VIII</h2>
<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>

<p>The newspapers were mercifully brief upon the
subject of the unsupported accusation brought
against Corrie Rose, although diffuse enough in
accounts of the much-known Gerard's disaster.
The driver's own explanation of his accident was
accepted; his attitude towards the young amateur
fixed the attitude of the public. Moreover, Jack
Rupert was stricken suddenly dumb; no reportorial
blandishments could obtain from him, on the
second day, so much as an admission of the
charges made by him on the day previous. Rupert
surrendered like a gentleman: he laid down all his
weapons. Dean's appearance at his usual duties
and explanation of his absence from the pink car
quashed the last rumor, for the finding of a wrench
beside a motor course meant nothing, considered
alone.</p>

<p>The first things for which Mr. Rose looked each
morning were the daily papers. After which, he
invariably shot a glance of blended relief and
smarting humiliation into the wide, earnest eyes
of Flavia, as she sat opposite him behind the gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
coffee-service, and addressed himself to his breakfast.
He never looked towards his son at that
moment, nor did Corrie ever break the ensuing
silence. The change that had fallen upon Allan
Gerard's life was scarcely more absolute and
strange than that which had come upon the Rose
household of innocent ostentation and intimate
gayety.</p>

<p>But the greatest outward alteration was in
Isabel. Flavia and Mr. Rose maintained the usual
calm routine of events at home and abroad, Corrie
rigidly obeyed his father's command to live so as
to provoke no comment. But Isabel's boasted,
perfect nerves were shattered beyond such control.
She moped all day in her own room, rejecting
Flavia's companionship, and fled from Corrie with
unconcealed avoidance. Nor did she improve, as
the days passed, but rather grew worse in condition.</p>

<p>It was in the sixth week after the accident
whose echoes threatened to linger so long, that
Isabel entered her cousin's study, one afternoon.</p>

<p>"Flavia, I am going away," she abruptly announced.
"Mrs. Alexander has asked me to go
South with Caroline and her, you know. Uncle
says I may do as I like, and I am going. I
can't bear it here," her full lip quivered.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Flavia turned from the window by which she
had been standing, catching and crushing a fold
of the drapery in her small fingers as she faced
the other girl.</p>

<p>"You mean that you cannot bear Corrie," she
retorted, in swift reproach. "You treat him&mdash;<i>how</i>
you treat him! You hardly speak to him, you
hardly look at him. Oh, you are cruel, you will
not see how he suffers for one moment's fault."</p>

<p>Isabel grasped a chair-back, commencing to
tremble.</p>

<p>"I can't bear to stay," she repeated hysterically.
"Don't talk to me about Corrie."</p>

<p>"I never will again," Flavia assured, pale with
extreme anger. "Yet you might remember that
he loves you; a little kindness from you would
help him so much. Do you know where he spent
yesterday? He was out in his motor boat; out
in November with a north gale blowing, alone in
that speed-boat that is half under water all the
time. You do not care, you have no pity."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Flavia imposed silence with a gesture, herself
quite unconscious of how overwhelming was this
contrast to her usual gentleness.</p>

<p>"He has done wrong&mdash;you have nothing to
give him but more punishment. Yes, go away,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
that is best. But he would have been kinder to
you, Isabel."</p>

<p>Isabel let go of the chair, her gray eyes dilating
unnaturally. Her gaze dwelling on Flavia, she
slowly retreated a few steps towards the door,
then suddenly turned and fled, leaving no answer.</p>

<p>With her going, Flavia's passion died, something
like fear taking its place. That was what Corrie
had felt, reflected Corrie's sister; a sweep of
flame-like anger that blinded judgment, a slipping
of self-mastery that loosed hand or tongue. Only,
she had not wanted to hurt Isabel, that was a
point she could not conceive reaching, herself.</p>

<p>When she had somewhat recovered, Flavia went
to find her furs and outdoor apparel. She knew
where Corrie had gone; she would meet him and
herself break the tidings of his cousin's coming
departure. He would be walking; he had not
touched an automobile since he left the seat of
his pink racer to rescue Gerard from beneath the
crushed Mercury, and he had no patience with
horses.</p>

<p>It was on a bleak, sandy stretch of Long Island
road that she met Corrie, a solitary figure against
the flat landscape as he came towards her. At
sight of her little carriage and the cream-colored
ponies he himself long before had taught her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
drive, he stopped, his boyish face brightening
warmly.</p>

<p>"Other Fellow," was all he said, when she
leaned towards him with her unaltering love of
glance and smile.</p>

<p>There was no need to ask where he had been.</p>

<p>"How is Mr. Gerard, dear?" she ventured,
after he was seated beside her and they had commenced
the return.</p>

<p>"Better."</p>

<p>"You go there every day to ask?"</p>

<p>"Every day."</p>

<p>"And, he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has seen me every day, even the worst.
He talks about politics, the aviation meet, the
motor magazines,&mdash;about everything except himself
or me. It is his right arm, now, the other
hurts are almost well. To-day I met the doctor,
going out as I was coming in. I asked about
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Flavia raised her eyes to meet his, shrinking
from the verdict that speech must establish beyond
the refuge of doubt. Very gently he laid
his hand over hers upon the reins and brought
the ponies to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Do you remember this place, Flavia? Well,
all that is over for him."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Beside them sloped away a brown, frost-seared
field; in its centre still showed the outline of a
baseball diamond, with the bags forgotten at the
bases. Flavia's heart contracted sharply, the
reins escaped her grasp. For the moment memory
and vision fused; she saw the straight, slender
pitcher poised with arms raised above his brown
head, saw his laughing glance go questing down
the field, and the swift, graceful movement that
launched the ball with unerring unexpectedness.
And because she could not speak without inadvertently
lashing Corrie, she sat mute.</p>

<p>She did not know how long it was before he
spoke, with the new steady seriousness so strange
to meet in him.</p>

<p>"Where are we getting to, Other Fellow? Because
we have got to get somewheres, you know;
we don't stand still. Gerard will go away to his
own home, soon. You and father and Isabel and
I can't just sit here looking at each other, like
we've been doing."</p>

<p>Gerard would go away, soon. That was the
sentence that gripped Flavia. Go, without seeing
her, without pursuing the purpose he had shown
her in the fountain arbor? It seemed so impossible
that the thrill that shook her was not of
fear, but of startled expectancy. Yet she answered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Corrie with scarcely a pause, and with all tenderness.</p>

<p>"Dear, Isabel will not be here, for a little
while," she told him, hesitatingly. "She is going
South with Mrs. Alexander and Caroline. She,
she needs the change."</p>

<p>"That's good," he approved. "She will be
better off, away from here, and you will be better
for her going. She worries us all with her fidgets."</p>

<p>Amazed, Flavia turned in her seat to regard
him.</p>

<p>"Corrie!"</p>

<p>"You thought I would mind?" He smiled
whimsically. "Flavia, I've had a lot of nonsense
knocked out of me. It took a bad shock to cure
me of Isabel, but I'm well. There's nothing left
of that. In fact, I feel all full of holes where
ideas have been jolted out of me&mdash;I feel rather
empty."</p>

<p>The beautiful foreign motor car had
stolen along the road so silently that neither
brother nor sister perceived its approach until
the grind of applied brakes sounded beside the
stopped carriage.</p>

<p>"I should have supposed that there'd be views
in the countryside more pleasant to this family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
than that field," caustically observed Mr. Rose.
"You can take the machine on home, Lenoir; I'll
drive with Miss Rose."</p>

<p>He descended, the chauffeur stooping to open
the door, while Corrie and Flavia looked on, too
much surprised to find reply.</p>

<p>"Keep your seat," he curtly ordered, as his
son rose to yield the place beside Flavia. "I'll
get up here. Drive ahead, my girl."</p>

<p>He took the rear seat of the little carriage,
resting his arm on the cushioned back so that
his strong, square-set head was between the two
who sat in front. The automobile obediently sped
on, and only the beat of the ponies' hoofs interrupted
the chill afternoon hush for the first half-mile.</p>

<p>"It's a long time since I found out that you
had some points that I didn't just understand,
Corrie," Mr. Rose stated, his matter-of-fact accents
carrying a deliberate finality. "I didn't wonder,
nor I didn't try to force you to fit my pattern;
we were solid friends and I was willing to take
on faith your ways of being different. Once in a
while I'd bring you on the carpet when you got
across the line, not often. You were given about
everything you wanted and only told that you
must keep straight. You haven't done it."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>An odd shiver ran through Corrie, but he said
nothing.</p>

<p>"This isn't a theatre; there won't be any talk
of cutting you off with a shilling or any other
kind of child's talk. What we have got to do
is to make the best of a bad thing. You will
have to go away for a year or two, keep apart
from automobile racing and automobile people, and
live gossip down. Poor Gerard did his best for
you&mdash;God knows why&mdash;but there are rumors
whispered around yet. It would have looked like
running away to go before; now, Gerard is out
of danger. Well?"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking that I should like to go
away for a time, sir," Corrie answered, gravely
self-contained.</p>

<p>"Very good. To speak out, it will be better
for our future living together if you're not in
my sight for a while now. If we stay housemates,
there is likely to be another kind of a
crash, and two crashes don't mend a break. You'll
have all the money you want and I don't care
where you go or how much you spend. Just put
in a year as well as you can, until we all settle
down and go on again. We have got a lifetime
before us to get through."</p>

<p>After a moment Corrie quietly took the reins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
from Flavia; blinded by tears, she was letting
the ponies stray at will.</p>

<p>The brief November day was ending; it was
dusk when they reached the house, and perhaps
none of the three were ungrateful for the shadows
which veiled them from one another. On the
veranda, Corrie detained his sister, allowing Mr.
Rose to enter alone.</p>

<p>"I'm not coming in just yet, Other Fellow,"
he said. "Ask father to excuse me from dinner;
I have an errand that cannot wait. I don't want
you to worry about me or to be unhappy. I did
a lot of thinking yesterday, out in the speed-boat
by myself; I know what I am going to do and
that I will put up the best fight I can. Go help
father; don't fret over me."</p>

<p>He kissed her soft mouth with the man's firmness
so different from his former casual caresses,
and went down the broad steps, walking across the
lawns in the direction from which they had just
come.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>IX</h2>
<h3>THE HOUSE AT THE TURN</h3>

<p>Dinner at the Rose house took place about
two hours after the corresponding meal occurred
at the farmhouse near the Westbury Turn. So
while Corrie was walking through his five miles
of desolate, dark road, the evening became well
under way in the country parlor; sick-room no
longer.</p>

<p>There had been changes in the room since
Gerard's occupancy of it. Bright rugs and coverings
mitigated the severity of the horse-hair
furniture, a couple of easy-chairs stood there like
velvet-clad cavaliers in a Puritan meeting. If the
hues ran to vivid scarlets and unexpected contrasts,
why, Rupert had done the shopping and
had consulted his own taste. In the midst of his
artistic work, that one-time mechanician and self-installed
nurse of Gerard's was now seated beside
a red-shaded lamp, engaged in reading aloud to
his companion from a classic found on the family
book-shelf.</p>

<p>"'Thaddeus, his eyes cast down, glided from
the room in a gentle suffusion of tears,'" he con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>cluded
a paragraph, and broke off, stunned.
"Gee! And I was understanding that was a man!
I ain't qualified for the judges' stand, but&mdash;did
you ever strike this joy-promoting endurance run
of language before?"</p>

<p>"Once. I didn't have you to read it to me,
or I would have enjoyed it more," Gerard returned,
stirring in his arm-chair opposite the ruddily
glowing German stove. "Don't you want to
give me a cigarette; I haven't had one since noon."</p>

<p>He was thinner and still colorless, otherwise
there was little to show what the last month and
a half had meant to Allan Gerard. Except when
he rose or moved, the inert uselessness of his right
arm was not obvious. And however hard the
battles and rebellion he inwardly had passed
through, tone or expression carried no outward
intelligence of past conflict as he smiled across at
his entertainer. Gerard possessed in full measure
that Anglo-Saxon reticence which abhors the useless
display of emotions. Rupert balanced the
volume upon his knee and proceeded to comply
with the request, twisting his dark little face
sardonically.</p>

<p>"When I was racing with Darling French,"
he reminisced, "we gave out of oil, once, on a
practice run across country. There was a house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
by the busy curb representing itself as the only
one combination garage and grocery store, so
Darling contracted for a can of warranted cylinder
oil in a speed dash that left the man all used up
and rattling mad. Being in some haste, we didn't
look up that can's inner life, but chucked the
stuff where it would do the most good."</p>

<p>"Poor quality?"</p>

<p>"I ain't saying so. The complaint wasn't
quality, it was kind. That can surrounded the
finest brand of Koko Korn syrup, extra rich. They
had to knock down our motor with a set of cooking
utensils, and the man who did the job said it
was a candied peach."</p>

<p>Gerard laughed.</p>

<p>"Well?" he anticipated.</p>

<p>"Here's your smoke. Well, that type of literature
makes my thinks-motor feel as if molasses
was being poured into it for lubrication&mdash;it sticks.
Will you take it hard if I raise my voice over the
sporting page of the evening paper, instead?"</p>

<p>Gerard nodded consent, but checked the reply
on his lips, listening. The outer door had opened
and closed, someone could be heard speaking to
the mistress of the house.</p>

<p>"Corrie Rose!" he marvelled.</p>

<p>Rupert carefully laid <i>Thaddeus</i> on the table
and stood up, straightening his small, wiry figure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
"I'll crank up and run out," he observed nonchalantly.
"Signal when you want me back."</p>

<p>There was no need of explanation; since the
day of the Mercury's wreck, Rupert had never
voluntarily remained in the same room with Corrie
or had exchanged speech with him. The two
passed at the doorway, now, with a curt nod on
the part of the mechanician in response to the
visitor's salute.</p>

<p>It was not a heartening reception, nor could
Gerard's cordial greeting lift the shadow of it
from Corrie's expression. That long solitary walk
had left his young face drawn with a white fatigue
not physical. But his eyes did not avoid Gerard's,
and for the first time he spoke of the subject
always present in the minds of both.</p>

<p>"You ought to hate the sight of me worse
than Rupert does," he abruptly opened. "But&mdash;you
don't. I don't know why, but you don't."</p>

<p>"No, I certainly do not," Gerard confirmed,
his grave eyes on his guest.</p>

<p>Corrie rested one hand upon the narrow mantel,
looking down at the fire-bright squares of the
stove. He still wore his gray overcoat and held
his cap, as if prepared to accept dismissal.</p>

<p>"You understand how easily things can go
wrong," he said. "I never used to understand
that, but I do now. You have seen drivers go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
wild in the race fever, more than once. We have
both seen the nicest, sweetest fellows curse and
strike their mechanicians because of a lost minute,
seen men whose nerve never balked at a risk sit
down and cry like girls when their car went out
of a race. There is a mark on my car now
where Ralph Stanton once scraped off the paint
in passing because I was slow in getting out of
his way. I suppose you judged mine such a case
and forgave a moment's insanity. No one else ever
will. You," his violet-blue eyes suddenly sought
the other man's, "you won't think I am trying
to excuse any such thing as was done to you or
to justify my part."</p>

<p>"No," Gerard answered, compassionately translating
the last weeks' writing on the candid face.
"I am not likely to think that, Corrie. But do
not give me credit not due; I am not unusually
forgiving or wise, it is, indeed, merely that I understand
fairly well. And when one understands the
other man, there seldom is anything to forgive."</p>

<p>"Thank you. It's because you always understand
one that I've come here to-night. I, I guess
I've about realized that I'm not quite nineteen
years old yet and pretty much a fool. I don't suppose
anyone ever meant better than I did, or ever
did worse at it. Gerard, my father has sent me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
off. Oh, not like that!" as the other man moved,
startled. "I mean, he has told me to go away
for a year or two, anywhere I like, until people
forget. He says he doesn't want to see me for
a while. No one does, except my sister. There
is no one on earth for whom I care who looks the
same as before at me except her, and you. I'm
sent off to live alone and I have never been alone
in my life. I'm afraid of myself, sick, afraid to
be alone&mdash;take me with you."</p>

<p>"Corrie?"</p>

<p>The boy's impetuous gesture interrupted.</p>

<p>"Don't say no! It ought to kill me to look
at you, it almost does, but it's worse away. Let
me go where you are going, let me work in your
factory, if it's at shovelling coal. Don't send me
off alone with more money than I can spend and
nothing to do with myself. I can't stand it&mdash;I'd
go under! You would better have let Rupert
send me to prison for wrecking your car. I've
tried to stand what seemed up to me, but I'm
near my limit. Gerard, help me see it through."</p>

<p>There was a quality of desperation in the appeal
that was like a clutching grasp. Gerard
felt his own nerves draw tense while his answer
leaped to the present and future need.</p>

<p>"You are the exact man I want at the factory,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Corrie," he assured, with all steadying naturalness
and calm. "Take off your overcoat and
come sit down; you are not going right out again.
I've got work for you that will keep you guessing,
as Rupert says. Let me see, it's eight o'clock
and you walked over; I'll wager you have had no
dinner."</p>

<p>"I don't want anything," Corrie refused, his
face averted, his fingers gripping the mantel-shelf
until his nails showed white from pressure.</p>

<p>"All right; I do. I declined my coffee and
some of Mrs. Carter's ambrosial apple pie, this
evening, and I have been repenting ever since.
You are a fine pretext for having them brought
in to us now. Besides, I shall have to keep you
in good shape if you are going to help me put
through a scheme of mine. Of course, I am not
altering my plan of living merely because I have
got one arm to use in place of two. I have to
have some things done for me instead of doing
them myself, that's all. I need you," he paused,
and lifted to his companion the cordial brilliancy
of his smile, "and I am glad to have you, Corrie."</p>

<p>When, an hour later, the guest rose to depart,
Gerard detained him for a final word.</p>

<p>"One thing before you go," he said, with a
quiet force of command that belonged to the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Allan Gerard whom Corrie had not yet encountered&mdash;the
master of many men and affairs, instead
of the racing driver and social playmate. "We
will not speak again of the subject we have concluded
to-night. I do not wish the accident to
the Mercury recalled or discussed between us,
ever. We are beyond that. Good night; I suppose
you would rather start with me, day after
to-morrow, than alone, later?"</p>

<p>Long afterward Gerard came to remember that
straight glance of utter helplessness and struggling
confusion from Corrie's tired eyes.</p>

<p>"I, I can't <i>think</i>," confessed Corrie Rose. "I'm
in too deep to find a way out. I&mdash;my head&mdash;&mdash;"
he pushed back his heavy fair hair. "Yes, I'd
rather start with you, if you will let me. Tell
me whatever you want of me, Gerard; I'll always
do it. Good night."</p>

<p>The closing of the outer door was the signal
for Rupert's return to the parlor.</p>

<p>"Your time on the track is up," he reminded,
"and you need your sleeps."</p>

<p>"I am not sleepy, Rupert. We will go home to
the factory, day after to-morrow, and continue
work on that special racing car of mine. Corrie
Rose is going to drive it when it is done, since I
cannot."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The mechanician slowly stiffened.</p>

<p>"Not precisely?" he refused credence.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; for practice and testing, at first,
and racing later. Until it is built I shall put him
in training on one of the ninety Mercuries. He
doesn't yet know anything about it, himself, and
he isn't going to be told until I am ready. You
are going to ride with him and break him in. He
has to be taught a good deal to change him from
a clever amateur to a professional driver."</p>

<p>"When I sit in a car beside Rose, it'll be because
I'm taking him to be lynched," Rupert explicitly
set forth.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest."</p>

<p>Gerard rested his head against the cushioned
chair-back and met the inflexible black eyes with
the cool, mischievous resolution of his own regard,
saying nothing at all.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>X</h2>
<h3>SENTENCE OF ERROR</h3>

<p>It was nearly twelve o'clock, that night, when
Corrie arrived home. Flavia ran down the wide
staircase to meet him, finger on lip; a childish
figure in the creamy lace and silk of her negligee,
with her heavy braids of shining hair falling over
her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You are so late," she grieved. "And so cold!
Come near the hearth&mdash;papa is in the library,
still."</p>

<p>Corrie allowed her small urgent hands to draw
him towards the fireplace that filled the square
hall with ruddy reflections and dancing shadows.
He was cold to the touch, ice clung to the rough
cloth of his ulster, but there was color and even
light in the face he turned to her.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> snowing," he recalled. "But I'm not
cold. I am going to bed and to sleep. I want
you to sleep, too, Other Fellow, because the worst
of it all is over. I don't mean that things are
right&mdash;they never can be that again, I suppose&mdash;but
I see my way clear to live, now."</p>

<p>She gazed up at him attentively, sensitively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
responsive to the vital change she divined in him.
Before he could continue or she question, Mr.
Rose came between the curtains of the arched
library door, a massive, dominant presence as he
stood surveying the two in the fire-light. He
made no remark, yet Corrie at once moved to face
him, gently putting Flavia aside.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to be so late, sir; I have been
arranging for my going away," he gave simple
account of himself. "I should like to leave the
day after to-morrow, if you do not object. I am
going to stay with a western friend. I know you
would rather not hear much about me or from
me for a while, but I will leave an address where
I can always be reached."</p>

<p>It is not infrequently disconcerting to be taken
promptly and literally at one's word. Moreover,
Corrie looked very young and pathetically tired,
with his wind-ruffled fair hair pushed back and in
his bearing of dignified self-dependence. A quiver
passed over Mr. Rose's strong, square-cut countenance,
his stern light-gray eyes softened to
a contradiction of his set mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm not in the habit of saying things twice,"
he curtly replied. "I gave you leave to go when
and where you pleased. To-morrow I'll fix your
bank account so you can draw all the money you
like."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," Corrie acknowledged.</p>

<p>"You've no call to thank me," his father corrected.
"I guess that when I own millions you've
got the right to all you can spend. It won't help
anything for you to be pinched or uncomfortable.
I've no wish to see it. I am going to take your
sister to Europe for the winter, as I told her this
evening, so we ourselves leave soon after you. Try
to keep straighter, this time."</p>

<p>There was no intentional cruelty in the concluding sentence,
delivered as the speaker stepped
back into the inner room, but Corrie turned so
white that Flavia sprang to him with a low exclamation
of pain.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he reassured her. And after a
moment: "Flavia, I am going with Allan Gerard,
to work under him and help him in his factory."</p>

<p>"Corrie?"</p>

<p>"I have been with him to-night. I don't want
father to know this because he wouldn't understand;
he might even forbid me to go. Unless he
forces an answer, I shall not say where I am to be.
But Gerard said I must tell you everything and
write to you often&mdash;I would have done that, anyhow.
You won't mind my going away, now, when
you know I am with him?"</p>

<p>She comprehended at last the change in him, the
change from restless uncertainty to steady fixity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of purpose, from an objectless wanderer to a traveller
towards a known destination, comprehended
with a passionate outrush of gratitude to the man
who had wrought this in a generosity too broad to
remember his own injury. The eyes she lifted to
her brother's were splendidly luminous.</p>

<p>"No," she confirmed, in the exhaustion of relief.
"I can bear to let you go from me, if you are to
be with Mr. Gerard."</p>

<p>They nestled together&mdash;as each might have
clung in such an hour to the mother they had left
so far down the path of years&mdash;on the hearth from
which one was self-exiled and the other about to
be taken.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the story he told us?" Corrie
asked, after a long pause. "About that Arabian
fellow's vase and the pearls, you know? I&mdash;well,
I meant what I said, about expecting to have
lots of days like that, pearl-days. I couldn't see
any farther than that! Yet that night&mdash;I don't
expect now, what I did then; I've lost my chance
for it. But I would like to do something for Allan
Gerard before I die. I'd like to make all my
pearls into one, and put it into his vase. Instead,
he is doing things for me."</p>

<p>Her clasping arms tightened about him. Heretofore
she always had turned a steady face to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
brother, sparing him the reproach of grief, but
now she helplessly felt her eyes fill and overflow.
One comfort, one hope she had that he did not
share. If he went with Allan Gerard, and if
Gerard took home the wife he had seemed to woo,
brother and sister would not be separated. Flavia
Gerard would be in Allan Gerard's house, where
Corrie was going.</p>

<p>Had Gerard thought of that, also? Dared she
tread on this nebulous fairy-ground? Dared she
lead Corrie to set foot there, with her?</p>

<p>"Dear," she essayed, her voice just audible,
"dear, has Mr. Gerard ever spoken to you of
me?"</p>

<p>Surprised, Corrie looked down at the bent head
resting against his rough overcoat. Himself a
lover, he yet had not suspected this other romance
flowering beside his own; he did not guess the
obvious secret, now.</p>

<p>"Of you? Oh, yes; he asks if you are well,
each day. He never forgets such things. Why?"</p>

<p>She had no answer to that natural question. In
spite of her reason, Flavia was chilled by the flat
conventionality of Gerard's apparent attitude, as
represented by those formal inquiries. Almost she
would have preferred that he had not spoken of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
her at all; silence could not have implied indifference.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she faltered. It clearly was impossible
to speak as she had imagined. "Only,
as his hostess, and your sister, I fancied that he
might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't say that sort of thing to me,
Other Fellow. No doubt he will come to pay a
farewell call before he leaves. He isn't very fit,
you know; he hasn't been out yet. He <i>must</i> be at
his western factory this week, he said, or he
wouldn't try to travel."</p>

<p>Her color rushed back. Why had she not remembered
that? Why should he speak of her to
anyone, since to-morrow he would come to see her?
To-morrow? The clocks had struck midnight, to-day
they would see each other.</p>

<p>"It is late," Corrie added, as if in answer to
her thought. He sighed wearily. "You are tired,
I suppose we both are. Come up."</p>

<p>He passed his arm about her waist, and they
went up the stairs together, leaning on one
another. But Allan Gerard was a third presence
with them, and in their sense of his guardianship
brother and sister rested like children comforted.</p>

<p>The following day was one filled with an atmosphere
of disruption and imminent departure. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
very servants caught the contagion and hurried
uncomfortably about their tasks. Corrie's preparations
were unostentatious, but Isabel's agitated
the entire household. Also, Mr. Rose issued his
instructions that Flavia should be ready to start
for France on the next steamer sailing. The
house that had been rose-colored within and without
was become a gray place to be avoided.</p>

<p>Flavia thought all day of Allan Gerard. She
knew her father went in the afternoon to pay him
a farewell visit, she knew Corrie was with him all
the morning, and when each returned home she
suspended breath in anticipation of hearing the
step of a guest also&mdash;the step of Gerard coming
towards the goal which he had half-showed her
in the fountain arbor. But Corrie and Mr. Rose
each entered alone.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she chose to wear his color, that
night; the pale, glistening tea-rose yellow above
which her warm hair showed burnished gold. He
must come that evening, if at all; she would be
truly "Flavia Rose" to him.</p>

<p>She was standing alone before her mirror, setting
the last pearl comb in place, when her cousin
came into the room.</p>

<p>"You look as if you were happy enough," Isabel
commented fretfully. "I don't believe you care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
at all about Corrie's going away. Of course you
don't care about me. What are you putting on
that old-fashioned thing for?"</p>

<p>Flavia gravely turned her large eyes upon the
other girl; the unjust attack fell in harsh dissonance
with her own mood of hushed anticipation.
She could not have robed herself for her wedding
with more serious care and earnest thoughtfulness
than she had used in preparing to receive Gerard
to-night. This was no time for coquetry; as he
came for her, she would go to him, she knew, without
evasion or pretense to harass his weakness.
She shrank, wincing sensitively, from this rough
criticism, but every member of the family had
learned not to reply to the new Isabel's peevish
tartness.</p>

<p>"It was my mother's," she explained, to the
last inquiry, tenderly lifting the long chain of
pearl and amber beads ending in a lace-fine pearl
cross. Never could she attempt to tell her cousin
the blended motives from which she had chosen to
wear this rosary. "And her mother's and again
her's. It is very old Spanish work. Shall we go
down?"</p>

<p>"What for? It is not time for dinner. Oh,
Martin told me there was a messenger waiting to
deliver a letter, just now, as I came here."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>The color flared up over Flavia's delicate face.</p>

<p>"A messenger, Isabel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, who would not send up his message. I
told Martin that we would ring."</p>

<p>Flavia slowly wound the chain around her
throat. There was no escape from Isabel's insistent
companionship, she realized.</p>

<p>"Ring, then, please," she requested, and passed
into her little sitting-room, beyond.</p>

<p>Isabel followed curiously, ensconcing herself in
one of the easy-chairs and idly twitching blossoms
from the hyacinths in a bowl near her. All
day she had been especially nervous and irritable,
her least movements were characterized by an impatience
almost feverish.</p>

<p>The messenger who appeared on the threshold
was Jack Rupert, not in the familiar guise of the
Mercury's mechanician, but Rupert at leisure; a
small, immaculate figure as New Yorkese as
Broadway itself. The movement that brought
Flavia across to him was impulsive as a confident
child's and accompanied by a candid radiance of
glance and smile flashed straight into the visitor's
black eyes. She had no attention to spare to the
fact that Isabel also had risen.</p>

<p>"You have been so good as to bring a message
to me, Mr. Rupert?" she questioned happily.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't denying it was a pleasure to come," he
made gracious reply, with his slight drawl of
speech. "I've been given this to deliver to Miss
Rose, from Mr. Gerard, under orders to bring the
answer back unless it was preferred to send it by
Mr. Rose, junior, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"This" was a letter. As Flavia held out her
hand to receive it, Isabel reached her side and
seized her wrist so fiercely as to bruise the soft
flesh.</p>

<p>"It is mine!" she panted. "Give it to me&mdash;it
is mine!"</p>

<p>Flavia stood still, looking at the other girl with
slow-gathering, incredulous resentment and
wonder.</p>

<p>"Yours? You expected this from Mr. Gerard,
Isabel?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;Corrie warned me he would,"
Isabel stammered. "You shall not read it, Flavia
Rose, you shall not! It is for me, for me&mdash;no
one must see it."</p>

<p>She was trembling in a vehement excitement
half-hysteric. Very quietly Flavia disengaged her
arm from the grasp holding it; for the moment
Isabel's touch was loathsome to her.</p>

<p>"For whom is the letter, my cousin or me?"
she asked the bearer.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess there ain't any answer; I don't know,"
avowed Rupert, troubled and hesitant. "I was
sent out to report to Miss Rose."</p>

<p>"But you, yourself, for whom did you suppose
it?"</p>

<p>"I ain't certain I did any supposing. Mr.
Gerard began it after Mr. Rose had been with
him, yesterday, and it took from then till to-night
to finish."</p>

<p>"It is <i>mine</i>," Isabel reiterated passionately.</p>

<p>The scene was utterly impossible, not to be
prolonged. It was the strong, cool determination
inherited from Thomas Rose that held Flavia equal
to the demands of her mother's bequeathment of
reticent pride.</p>

<p>"Pray give the letter to my cousin," she requested,
her calm never more perfect. "I am
sorry to have confused so simple a matter. She
will of course recognize for which of us it is intended."</p>

<p>But she meant to see the letter. Even as she
watched Isabel snatch the surrendered missive,
Flavia told herself that this sentence of error could
not be accepted without sight of the letter. Moving
with deliberate stateliness, she crossed to a
chair near a small table and sat down, taking up
a book. She was conscious that Rupert watched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
her, and she would make no sign that might constitute
a self-betrayal when recounted to Gerard if
she were indeed so pitifully wrong and he had from
the first chosen her cousin. What she was not
in the least aware of, was the inevitable impression
made upon the mechanician by the dazzling little
room and her central figure of gold upon gold and
pearl-and-amber, and by her still, colorless face set
in all this sheen and lustre. Had he been as dull
as he really was acute, this scene could not have
been made casual to him.</p>

<p>Isabel's shaking fingers shredded the envelope
in extracting the sheet of paper, her eyes scanned
the page avidly. The result was unanticipated;
there was a sharp cry, an instant of indecision,
then as savagely as she had claimed the letter she
sprang to thrust it into the startled Flavia's lap.</p>

<p>"I can't do it! Flavia, I can't see him&mdash;I
can't bear it! Tell him no&mdash;to go away&mdash;it's all
over, now."</p>

<p>The desperate terror and dread of the cry
charged the atmosphere of the room with vibrant
intensity. Flavia caught the letter.</p>

<p>"I am to read this?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes; read it, help me."</p>

<p>Isabel had seen and still claimed as hers the
message. Yes, and had expected it, so that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
must have been other communication between her
and the sender. The conviction of her own utter
mistake struck Flavia down with a force that
crushed reason under feeling. She was physically
giddy as she unfolded the page.</p>

<p>The writing was uncertain and angular; different
indeed from the firm smooth script that had
accompanied the box of yellow roses in giving the
"definition of the meaning of <i>Flavia Rose</i>." The
mute evidence of that difficult left-handed task
pierced the girl who loved Allan Gerard, before
she read the words.</p>

<p>The letter commenced abruptly, without superscription.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I think you will know how hard it is for me to
speak to you calmly, even this way, across this distance,
remembering how we last met. To you I can confess
what I could to no one else, since there is now an end
of concealment between us; that is, that Allan Gerard is
so weak as to feel shame at being a cripple. So much so,
that the idea is intolerable of first remeeting you amidst
your household's pitying curiosity. I never used to know
I had a personal vanity; I fancy it is not quite that, but
rather the humiliation of the man who has always been
well-dressed and who suddenly finds himself sent into
public sight in a shabby, tattered garment. I had accepted
my physical conventionality as part of my social equipment.
I do not say this in reproach to anyone or to affect you;
I am perfectly sure that you will not offer me the last
insult of supposing so or of answering me from that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
viewpoint. I say it only to excuse my very great presumption
in asking you to drive with Corrie to the little
railway station, to-morrow morning, to take leave of him&mdash;and
to tell me whether I am to come back. I want you
to see me as I am now, before you determine. Perhaps,
left to my own impulse of shielding you, I would have gone in
silence, but justice is higher than sentiment; you have
the right to hear what I must say and to answer it as you
will.</p>

<p>"I am going to do my best for Corrie, whatever happens.
Please trust me so far, and if I have offended or seemed
to fail in this letter, remember my past months in excuse.</p>

<p class="ralign">"Allan Gerard."</p>
</div>

<p>Flavia laid down the sheet of paper. In that
moment she suffered less from the destruction of
her own happiness than from the destruction of
Gerard's. This cry out of his anguish to the one
for whom alone he had broken the stoical muteness
in which he had wrapped his endured pain of mind
and body, this self-revelation that was the difficult
baring of a heart not used to show itself and
avowal of weakness at the core of so much strength,
drew from her an outrush of maternal protectiveness
that rolled its flood above personal grief. If she
could have sent Isabel to him, then, an Isabel
worthy of the high trust and pathetic dignity in
humility of that letter, she could have accepted
her own sorrow. But she knew Isabel Rose, knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
the vanity of that hope even as she tried to realize
it.</p>

<p>"You know what Mr. Gerard wishes to say
to you, to-morrow?" she asked composedly. If
the composure was overdone, it was the error of
a novice in acting.</p>

<p>The other girl shrank back.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, why do you not answer him? Surely,
if you expected him to write this, you must answer
him."</p>

<p>"I will not!" Isabel cried loudly and rebelliously.
"I will not go, I will not see him hurt
like that and hear him, hear him&mdash;&mdash;" she broke
off, fighting for breath. "Tell him to go away.
I can't help it now, I can't see him. It's all over!"</p>

<p>This was the woman Allan Gerard had chosen,
Flavia thought in bitter wonder; this self-centred,
hysterical girl whose love could not survive the
marring of her lover's outward beauty. Isabel
could not bear to go to him; the irony of it sank
deep into the girl who could scarcely bear to stay
away. But Flavia turned to the mute Rupert,
holding her dignity steadily above her pitiful confusion
of mind, striving, also, to ease this blow
to Gerard, who was so little fit to receive it.</p>

<p>"Pray inform Mr. Gerard that Miss Rose is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
unwell and hardly able to answer his letter now,"
she directed. "I hope she will be able to accompany
Mr. Corwin Rose, to-morrow morning, as he
suggests."</p>

<p>"No!" Isabel denied.</p>

<p>"I'll report, Miss Rose," Rupert asserted with
brevity.</p>

<p>The keen black eyes and the deep-blue ones met,
and read each other. Flavia took a step forward
and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"It is not probable that we shall meet again,
ever. Thank you," she said.</p>

<p>It would not have been possible to bribe Rupert
into silence, but Flavia had done better. She knew,
and the mechanician knew, as he touched her soft
fingers, that he would keep to himself the knowledge
that she had elevated to a confidence&mdash;the
knowledge that she loved Allan Gerard, and was
not loved in return.</p>

<p>So it happened that when Rupert returned to
the Westbury farmhouse, he literally repeated
Flavia's dictated message and contributed nothing
of additional information or detail&mdash;except that
he made one dry comment before retiring for the
night.</p>

<p>"There's just one of the Rose family that ain't
got any yellow streaks," he volunteered.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who?" was asked absently.</p>

<p>The response to his letter had left Gerard paler
than usual and very grave. He did not recognize
in it the Flavia he knew; the girl who had watched
her brother with such rich lavishness of affection,
the girl whose most innocent eyes had held the
possibilities of all Corrie's ardent young passion
without his impulsive faults, and whose warmth
of nature had drawn him as a fireside draws a
wanderer. He would not doubt her for such slight
cause, he would wait for morning and her further
answer, but he felt a premonitory dread and discouragement.
He had expected so much more
than he would now admit to himself. He even
had thought vaguely, unreasoningly eager as a
wistful boy, that she might come to him with Corrie
that evening, that he might see and touch her.</p>

<p>"The lady you didn't write to," answered his
mechanician. "Good night."</p>

<p>The next morning Corrie Rose went to the little
railway station, alone.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>XI</h2>
<h3>GERARD'S MAN</h3>

<p>The hard, glittering macadam track that swept
around the huge western factory of the Mercury
Automobile Company and curved off behind a
mass of autumn-gray woodland, was swarming
with dingy, roaring, nakedly bare cars. The
spluttering explosions from the unmuffled exhausts,
the voices of the testers and their
mechanics as they called back and forth, the
monotonous tones of the man who distributed
numbers for identification and heard reports from
his force, all blended into the cheery eight-o'clock
din of a commencing work-day. Three brawny,
perspiration-streaked young fellows were engaged
in loading bags of sand on the stripped cars about
to start out, to supply the weight of the missing
bodies, and whistling rag-time melodies to enliven
their labors.</p>

<p>In the shadow of one of the arched doorways
Corrie Rose stood to watch the scene, drawing full,
hungry breaths of the gasoline-scented, smoke-murked
air. There was more than frost this
December morning; ice glinted in the gutters and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
on the surface of buckets, the healthful lash of
the wind flecked color into the men's faces as
they pulled on heavy gloves and hooded caps. The
spirit of the place was action; the lusty vigor of
it tugged with kindred appeal at the inactive,
wistful one who looked on.</p>

<p>The heavy throb of the machinery-crowded
building smothered the sound of steps; a touch
was necessary to arouse the absorbed watcher.</p>

<p>"You've been here for almost a week, Corrie.
Don't you feel like getting to work?" queried
Gerard's pleasant tones.</p>

<p>The boy swung around eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he welcomed. "Give me something to
do, anything."</p>

<p>Gerard nodded, his amber eyes sweeping courtyard
and track until, finding the man he sought,
he lifted a summoning finger.</p>

<p>"Have someone bring out my six-ninety,
Rupert," he called across. "Right away." And
to his companion, "Get into some warm things;
you will find it cold, driving."</p>

<p>Corrie stiffened, flushing painfully and catching
his lip in his white teeth.</p>

<p>"Gerard, you mean <i>me</i> to drive?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I shall never drive a car again."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will drive the six-ninety Mercury for six
hours a day, every day," Gerard corrected explicitly.
"Until I get the big special racer built,
and then you will drive it. You are going to
work into the finest kind of training and drive
until you can drive in your sleep. Too bad the
winter is shutting in, but that will not stop you
any more than it does the testers. In fact, driving
in the snow is good practice."</p>

<p>Helpless, Corrie looked at the other man, his
violet-blue eyes almost black with repressed feeling.</p>

<p>"Gerard, you must know how I want to; don't
ask me! You know how I ache to get ahold of
a wheel, but I've forfeited all that."</p>

<p>"You have placed yourself in my factory, under
my orders," Gerard stated, with curt finality.
"While you are here you will do what I tell you
to do, precisely as does every other worker; precisely
as does Rupert, for example, who is really
tester at the eastern plant and ordinarily works
under its master, David French. I have decided
to give you a branch of the work that I once
planned to do myself and now cannot. Go into
the office and put on your driving togs."</p>

<p>"I ain't expecting to shove this ninety through
a letter-slot," remonstrated caustic accents from
across the busy courtyard. "Move over, girls,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
you're crowding the aisles! Say, Norris, this
ain't a joy-ride down Riverside Drive, it's a testing
run; reverse over there and take about six
more sachet-bags of mud-pie aboard where your
tonneau ain't, before you start. Don't it hurt
you bad to hurry like that, you fellows?"</p>

<p>There was a drawing aside by the cars opposite
a wide door, and the machine guided by Rupert
rolled through, winding a devious course toward
where its owner waited. Without a word, Corrie
turned and went into the office.</p>

<p>Gerard remained still, following with his gaze
the approach of the beloved car he would drive
no more, until it came to a halt before him.</p>

<p>"If we're going out, I'll fetch my muff and
veils," suggested the mechanician, leaning nearer.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Rupert. I am going with Rose,
myself, this first time. You can be ready this
afternoon, though."</p>

<p>Rupert's dark face twisted in a grimace, his
black eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"We're laboring under some classy mistake,"
he dryly signified. "I was inviting myself to go
with you. As for Rose, he and I won't perch on
the same branch unless we get lynched together
for horse stealing&mdash;and you know how I don't
love a horse."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>The amusement underlying Gerard's expression
rippled to the surface.</p>

<p>"All right," he acquiesced. "Detail someone
else. But, Rupert&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I think you will race next spring as Corrie
Rose's mechanician."</p>

<p>Their glances encountered, equally cool and
determined.</p>

<p>"I'll take in washing with a Chinese partner,
if you and Darling French throw me out," assured
Rupert kindly. "Don't worry about my future
like that."</p>

<p>And he slipped across the levers out of his
seat, eel-supple, as Corrie issued from the office.</p>

<p>There was a mile loop of the perfect macadam
track circling the factory buildings, then the way
ran off into the country roads, inches deep with
heavy sand, littered with ugly stones, rising over
and pitching down steep grades where holes and
mud-patches abounded. Over this the new Mercury
cars were driven at top speed, each one reckoning
many miles before the makers allowed them
to be clothed with bodies and gleaming enamels
and to be sent to the purchasers. No flaw escaped
unnoticed, no weakness passed. Jaws set under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
their masks, keen eyes on the road and keen ears
listening for the least false note in the tone-harmony
of their machines, the sturdy testers
drove through a day's work that would have prostrated
the average motorist. Out among these
men went Corrie Rose, more self-conscious than
he had ever been on race track or course.</p>

<p>"I never had a ninety before," he confided to
Gerard, as they finished the mile circuit. "A
sixty was my biggest. She's, she's a <i>beauty</i>!"</p>

<p>The car slammed violently off the macadam onto
the sand road, skidded in a half-circle and righted
itself with a writhing jerk.</p>

<p>"Mind your path," cautioned Gerard, in open
mirth. "This isn't a motor parkway. Hello!"</p>

<p>One of the smaller cars was coming towards
them, limping back to the shops with a broken
front spring. The man driving it touched his cap
to Gerard as they passed, swinging one arm behind
him in a significant gesture and shouting a
warning concerning the bridge ahead. Corrie
checked his speed, and barely skirted the deep
washed-out hole that had caused the other
machine's disaster.</p>

<p>"There was rain yesterday and freezing
weather last night," Gerard communicated, at his
ear. "Now it is beginning to melt again and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
playing the mischief with the roads. There is a
right-angle turn coming."</p>

<p>Corrie nodded, fully occupied. His blood sang
through his veins, his fingers gripped the steering-wheel
lovingly; he was revelling in the speed
exhilaration he had never expected to feel again.
The driver who hoped for no such commutation
of sentence watched him with quietly sad eyes;
eyes in which no one ever was allowed to surprise
their present expression, least of all Corrie Rose.</p>

<p>Near noon a tire blew out. Gerard sat on the
side of the Mercury and gave bits of ironical advice
to the worker while Corrie changed a tire alone
for the first time in his life. Corrie bore the
teasing sweetly, even when a tool slipped and tore
his cold-sensitized fingers.</p>

<p>"I know," he deprecated. "Dean always did
it and I just helped. I never did anything thoroughly;
an amateur isn't a professional. We
would have lost time by that in a road race."</p>

<p>"You will learn. Rupert and I used to do it
in two minutes from stop to restart," Gerard returned.
"There&mdash;gather up your tools; we will
go home to luncheon."</p>

<p>"To the factory, first?"</p>

<p>"No. Go slowly and I will show you a short
cut."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>But Corrie was not in a mood to go slowly, so
that they almost missed the driveway that
branched from the macadam track to curve around
into a park set thickly with fragrant cedars, central
in which grove stood the quaintly stiff house
of dark brick and stone.</p>

<p>"Run around to the garage," Gerard directed.
"Since you will want the car all the time, you
might as well keep it here and use the short cut
out to the road. I will get out here and go into
the house."</p>

<p>Corrie obediently bent to his levers.</p>

<p>"All the time?" he repeated, with an indrawn
breath of reluctant ecstasy. "All the time!"</p>

<p>As Gerard turned to the house, a small figure
advanced to meet him.</p>

<p>"We've sent out a gang to massage some of
the freckles defacing the speedway," Rupert informed
him. "Briggs chugged in with a broken
spring, Norris side-wiped a fence, and Phillips
fell into a hole without publishing a notice, so that
his mechanician got off over the bonnet and broke
his collar-bone. That ain't testing cars, it's
promoting funerals. It's easier to motor into
heaven on that road than to drive a camel in New
York. What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, have it put in order, of course. I sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>posed
that Mr. Dalton would attend to the matter,
since I was out. Rupert, who is the sharpest-tongued,
most cross-grained and least ceremonious
mechanician we have?"</p>

<p>"I am," was the prompt reply. "Were you
wanting me?"</p>

<p>Gerard looked at him and laughed.</p>

<p>"You have ruled yourself off the list of
eligibles," he declared. "I want a man to ride
with Corrie Rose."</p>

<p>"Oh!" ejaculated Rupert. His malicious,
shrewd face gained comprehension. "<i>Oh!</i> Well,
I ain't boasting, but I could do that job up pretty
fine. Failing me, Devlin is the nastiest thing on
the place. You couldn't pat his head without
pricking your fingers."</p>

<p>"Very well. Tell him to report to Rose hereafter,&mdash;and
do not tell him much else. Let all
the men know that Rose is training to take my
place in the racing work, but do not let them
know anything about his millionaire father or his
share in the Cup-race affair."</p>

<p>Rupert directed his gaze towards the inert
right arm hanging by Gerard's side.</p>

<p>"Your place," he echoed. "Are you giving in
without putting up a stiff fight?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerard's chin lifted, his eyes sprang to meet
the sharp challenge of the mechanician's.</p>

<p>"No. The fight will soon be on. Are you
going to be my second in it?"</p>

<p>"I'm guessing I'll be there when you look for
me."</p>

<p>Their eyes dwelt together for a long moment.</p>

<p>"I should like the men to treat Rose as they
do each other, so far as possible," Gerard casually
resumed his original theme. "It will be good for
him. He needs roughing!"</p>

<p>Rupert ran his fingers through his crisp black
locks, wheeling to depart.</p>

<p>"He'll slip control and run wild," he predicted,
grimly vicious. "He needs the training you're
planning for him, all right, but he ain't got the
stuff in him to stand it. He'll slip control&mdash;here's
hoping he smashes himself this time!"</p>

<p>Gerard moved his head in disagreement.</p>

<p>"Wait," he advised. "You once said he could
not last out a certain twenty-four-hour race."</p>

<p>"He didn't."</p>

<p>"He finished in third place."</p>

<p>"Because you helped him through, that's why.
He didn't have to do it alone."</p>

<p>"He doesn't have to do this alone, either," reminded
Gerard.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert looked at him, then walked away, every
line of his body reiterating the prediction he could
not sustain argumentatively.</p>

<p>It was half an hour later that Corrie came into
the room to join his host, carrying a letter in
his hand.</p>

<p>"It is from Flavia," he volunteered. "She
promised to write as soon as they got across, but
she did better; she wrote this on board the steamer
so that it was all ready to send." He sat down
in his place and rested his arms on the table in the
boyish attitude so associated with the massively
rich dining-room of his father's house and the
light-hearted group who had gathered there. "It
was like her to do better than her word,&mdash;she
doesn't know how to do less. One, one can tie up
to <i>her</i>."</p>

<p>Gerard continued to gaze out the window opposite,
his expression setting as if under a sudden
exertion of self-control.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, I was always fond of my sister, but
one learns a good deal more of people when things
go wrong than when they just run along right.
She asks me about you, how you are now."</p>

<p>"Miss Rose is too kind."</p>

<p>Some quality in the brief acknowledgment compelled
a pause. The once self-assertive Corrie had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
become acutely sensitive to any suggestion of
rebuff or disapproval. He could not in any way
divine this rebuke was not for him, or know of the
bruise he innocently had touched.</p>

<p>When the first course of the luncheon was
served, Gerard came over to his seat and opened
a new subject with his usual kindness of manner.
It was a curious fact that, although Gerard had
felt the awakening of love for Flavia Rose from
his first glimpse of her, he never had aided Corrie
for his sister's sake. Even when he had dragged
himself from the overwhelming blackness of pain
and the numbing effects of an&aelig;sthetics to defend
the driver whose foul blow had struck him down,
it was of Corrie alone he thought, not of Flavia,
Corrie whom he had shielded from disgrace and
open punishment. Man to man they had dealt
together, no woman, however dear, entered between
them. So when Flavia had seemed to fail
her lover, again the separateness had held and
Gerard never even imagined visiting her desertion
on her brother. He had not resented Corrie's
natural speech of her, now, but he could not listen
to it; not yet.</p>

<p>"You will find your regular mechanician waiting
for you when you go out again," he observed.
"You can learn much with him, if you choose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Corrie, although he is no Rupert. Take your
machine where and how you please; it is all practice.
I will see you again at dinner, unless you
grow tired before then and would like to come
up to the draughting-room to meet my chief engineer
and designer."</p>

<p>Corrie looked down, crumpling a fold of the
table cloth between nervous fingers.</p>

<p>"Gerard, do they know?" he asked, his voice
low. "I mean, how you were hurt and what
Rupert accuses me of?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. You are no one to them but
my new driver."</p>

<p>A still ruddier color tinged the young face, the
fair head bent a little lower.</p>

<p>"That is all I want to be, ever. Thank you,
Gerard; I'll make good."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>XII</h2>
<h3>THE MAKING GOOD</h3>

<p>Corrie did not slip control during the weeks
that followed. There was no running wild to
record. At first he used to come in from his
driving reddened by more than the cold wind,
and there were rumors current of certain vigorous
word-duels between him and his sullen assistant,
Devlin. But he never complained to Gerard
or exhibited any smart of excoriated vanity. The
testers accepted him as a little more than their
equal, after watching him drive, and he gladly
met their comradeship with his own. It was very
easy to like Corrie; soon he was surrounded by
friends.</p>

<p>Only Jack Rupert never spoke to him. The
thing was not done obtrusively, but it was done.
He never openly slighted Corrie Rose or showed
him discourtesy, he simply failed to come in contact
with him. And Corrie tacitly accepted the
situation, avoiding the inflexible mechanician, on
his part. So winter shut in, with blizzards that
frequently drove everyone off the roads until snow-ploughs
and shovels had accomplished their work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Then Gerard would summon Corrie to the inside
of the huge, reverberant factory, where amid its
lesser brothers the Titan racing machine was
slowly growing to completion; the Titan of
Gerard's past speed-visions, the dream-planned car
that was now for another's control. He taught,
and Corrie learned hungrily.</p>

<p>It was in February Corrie first noticed that
Gerard and Rupert simultaneously disappeared
for an hour and a half every morning. No one
knew why, or had interested enough to speculate,
it seemed. Gerard always sent Corrie off on some
duty, at that time each day, and only accidental
circumstances awoke the young driver's attention
to a custom without an explanation.</p>

<p>Of course, Corrie asked no questions. He was
not temperamentally curious and he was well-bred.
But, returning unexpectedly to the house, one
morning in early March, he passed Rupert going
out and realized himself encroaching on the tacitly
established period of retirement. Sobered, half-doubtful
of his course, he ran up the stairs, and in
the upper hall came suddenly upon Gerard leaning
against the wall.</p>

<p>"Gerard!" Corrie exclaimed; goggles and
gloves fell to the floor as he sprang to his friend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"Gerard, you're ill? Let me help you&mdash;lean on
me! I'm strong enough to <i>carry</i> you."</p>

<p>"It is nothing," Gerard panted. "I tried to
come after Rupert in too much of a hurry, that's
all. I remembered something I had forgotten to
tell him. What are you doing here? I sent you
out."</p>

<p>Once Corrie would have flashed hot retort to a
reproof certainly undeserved, not now.</p>

<p>"I am sorry; I didn't understand," he apologized.
"You never said I <i>must</i> stay out. Let me
help you, get you something."</p>

<p>"I know; I'm unreasonable!" Gerard
straightened himself. "Never mind me, Corrie;
I am all right now."</p>

<p>He was white with a singular pallor that Corrie
was too inexperienced to recognize, but he smiled
reassurance to his assistant and himself led the
way to the room opposite.</p>

<p>"There is some dose in the glass on the table,"
he indicated, finding a chair. "I might drink it,
if I had it here. And, don't you want to get me
a cigarette?"</p>

<p>In silence Corrie complied with the requests.
Beside the slight, colorless Gerard, he radiated
vigorous health and that scintillant freshness
drawn from days passed in sunlight and sweet air,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
but his eyes at this moment held a desperate
anxiety and unrest that left the advantage of contrast
to his companion's clear tranquillity of regard.</p>

<p>"You are getting worse," he declared abruptly.
"There is no use of trying to spare my feelings,
Gerard; instead of gaining, you are losing
strength."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; I am getting better,"
Gerard corrected with perfect assurance. He put
aside his glass and leaned back in his chair. "You
do not in the least know what you are talking
about. Since you are here, we might get a bit
of business done that I had meant to leave until
you came in to luncheon. You understand that
the formalities must be preserved; are you willing
to sign one of our regular driver's contracts, to
drive for the Mercury Company this year, and for
no one else?"</p>

<p>"I will do," said Corrie, "whatever you want.
Is this the paper?"</p>

<p>He took up a pen and, still standing, wrote
his name across the foot of the document, the
other man's attentive gaze following his movements.</p>

<p>"Is that the way you sign legal papers, Corrie,
without reading them?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The blue eyes gave the questioner one expressive
glance.</p>

<p>"You gave it to me," was the answer.</p>

<p>Gerard contemplated him, then drew another
printed sheet from a pile on the desk and pushed
it across.</p>

<p>"All right. I want you to sign this, too," he
signified.</p>

<p>As carelessly as before, Corrie set down his
signature and turned away from the half-folded
page.</p>

<p>"I came back early because I had a letter from
Flavia," he explained. "I wanted to answer it
right away. She says that father doesn't intend
to come home until autumn. I don't believe she
likes it much, but of course she wouldn't tell him
so. He has enough to stand."</p>

<p>Gerard drew the two papers towards him and
put them into a drawer. It is hard to be consistent;
the temptation of seeing Corrie read
Flavia's weekly letters had long since vanquished
the resolution of the man whose love for her seemed
to himself to illustrate that the economies of
Nature do not include human passion. Corrie
found a willing, if mute, listener to all confidences
in regard to his sister.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has never told Mr. Rose that you are
with me?" Gerard asked, to-day.</p>

<p>"No," he responded, surprised. "Oh no! She
promised me that, the night before I left home."</p>

<p>"Yet, living so close in thought with your
father as she does, I should have fancied&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That she couldn't help telling him? I don't
know who started that story that women can't
keep secrets." Corrie laughed mirthlessly. "From
what I have seen, they can keep quiet a secret
that would tear itself out of any man I ever met,
if the wrench killed him."</p>

<p>He unclasped the heavy fur coat he still wore
and pushed it aside from his throat with an impatient
air of oppression.</p>

<p>"But Flavia could not hurt anyone, and she
knows that would hurt me," he added, more gently.</p>

<p>Flavia could not hurt anyone. Allan Gerard
considered that statement, not so much in bitterness
as in a wonder that made all life uncertain.
He recalled the fountain arcade of rose-colored
columns and delicate lights, the sweetly demure
girl who waited there for her brother, and her last
brief glance of virginal candor and innocently unconscious
confession. Flavia could not hurt anyone.
Yet she had dismissed the man who loved
her, without even granting him the poor alms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
courteous sympathy, had left him to learn her
decision from her silence. Long since, he had
decided that he had been condemned as the cause
of her beloved brother's downfall, and now he again
excused her hardness to himself as a result of her
over-tenderness for Corrie. Either that, or he
himself had somehow failed, in some way had been
found lacking.</p>

<p>He never did Flavia Rose so much wrong as
to suppose her affected by the physical injury he
had suffered. If she had loved him, no such
change could have come between them. He knew
that no marring of her beauty would have had
effect upon his steadfast love for her, and he
rated her far above himself in all good things.</p>

<p>It was quite a quarter-hour before Gerard looked
up and saw that Corrie had remained standing
by the table in an abstraction complete as his
own, lips pressed shut and straight brows contracted.
Startled out of self-contemplation, the
older man leaned forward to give his aid to a
moment whose bitterness he divined.</p>

<p>"Corrie, take off your furs and come to
luncheon," he directed, crisply energetic. "You
have got to take out the Titan for its first run,
this afternoon."</p>

<p>Effectively aroused, Corrie swung around.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Titan?" he echoed. "To-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Come on."</p>

<p>In the thin, clear March sunshine, two hours
later, the Mercury Titan rolled out onto the mile
track, shaking earth and air with its roar and
vibrant clamor. The force of testers and factory
operatives crowded about, busy men found time
to cluster at the buildings' doors and windows in
keen interest.</p>

<p>Opposite Gerard and his little staff, the men
who had designed and evoked the winged monster,
Corrie Rose was in his seat, flushed with excitement,
but collected and at home in the powerful
machine which he was to be the first to test and
master. "Until you give it to its racing driver,
let no one except me take it?" he had begged of
Gerard. And Gerard had given the promise,
smiling oddly.</p>

<p>But if Corrie was eager for the start, his
mechanician palpably was not. The place beside
the driver remained vacant until the last moment,
when the reluctant Devlin slowly climbed into it.</p>

<p>"Devlin is nervous," Gerard gravely commented,
to his own one-time mechanician. "He is
a very good factory man, but this is too big work
for him. If they were going on a longer trip, I
should not like to send Corrie out with him."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ain't denying anything," snapped Rupert,
scowling after the departing car as it leaped for
the open track like an animal unleashed.</p>

<p>That first afternoon's trial of the Mercury
Titan proved it much faster than either the track
or road would stand. Also, Corrie Rose was
proved fully capable of handling his wheeled projectile.
When he came in, at dusk, the testers
regarded him with unconcealed respect; there was
genuine admiration mingled with the congratulations
offered him by the car's designers. He had
become, after Gerard, the most conspicuous man
in the great automobile plant.</p>

<p>Devlin crawled out of his seat and complained
of nausea.</p>

<p>On the third day of practice, when Corrie
brought the car back to the factory at noon,
Rupert suddenly walked up to him and broke the
silence of months.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your fifth cylinder?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>Amazed, Corrie slipped off his mask and turned
his fatigued face to the questioner.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," he deprecated, quite
humbly. "Devlin was too busy holding on to
do much, and I was driving."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert darted a glance of blighting contempt
at the sullen Devlin, and walked away.</p>

<p>Gerard had not seen the episode, nor did it
reach his ears. But he was chatting with Corrie,
late on the same afternoon, when Rupert emerged
from the factory and thrust an overcoat at the
young driver who stood beside his car.</p>

<p>"I ain't hanging out a diploma," he stated
acridly, "but this ain't summer by some months
and you're qualifying for a hospital&mdash;which I
don't guess is what you were brought here for."</p>

<p>"Thank you," faltered Corrie, and wonderingly
put on the garment.</p>

<p>Gerard continued to survey the machine before
him, not a flicker crossing his expression or betraying
consciousness of any unusual event.
Rupert's swift look of blended defiance and embarrassment
directed towards his chief glided off
an impenetrable surface.</p>

<p>Corrie followed with wistful eyes the mechanician's
return to the building.</p>

<p>"I knew a West Point fellow, once, who had
been given the 'silence' treatment&mdash;I used to
wonder why he minded so much," he laughed,
apropos of nothing, but his voice caught.</p>

<p>It was the first time Corrie had ever admitted
knowledge of Rupert's ostracism of him, or re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>vealed
how deeply the hurt had been felt. Gerard
laid a caressing hand on his shoulder, wisely saying
nothing. After a moment Corrie grasped the
Titan's steering-wheel and swung himself into his
seat behind it, but paused before summoning Devlin
to start the motor, and rewarded Gerard's
tact by another impulsive confidence, spoken just
audibly:</p>

<p>"I miss my father all the time. I think I
always will. And I would miss him most if he
came home and I had to live along side of him.
He&mdash;well, he stays in Europe. I'll put up the
car for the night, if you're ready to have me;
it's getting pretty dark to run any more."</p>

<p>"The car is in your hands; put it where you
please, when you please," responded Gerard; that
mark of trust seemed the only comfort he could
offer, then; he was too fine not to ignore the
other issues.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>XIII</h2>
<h3>THE TITAN'S DRIVER</h3>

<p>There was a letter for Corrie in the evening
mail, next day. At least, there was an envelope
containing a gaudy picture-postal. It was at this
last that Corrie was gazing, when Gerard came to
remind him that dinner waited, and of it he first
spoke.</p>

<p>"It's from Isabel. I&mdash;she need not have sent
it!" He abruptly pushed the card across the
table toward Gerard and turned away to complete
his preparations.</p>

<p>"A postal?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She used to be fond of writing long
letters, but she has quit the habit. Flavia tells
me she has not received but three postal-cards from
Isabel since they parted, although they used to be
such chums."</p>

<p>"I am to read?"</p>

<p>"If you like."</p>

<p>The red and green landscape represented,
libellously, the Natural Bridge of Virginia. Across
the glazed surface ran a few blurred lines of script:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Dear Corrie:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">May I marry someone else, if I want to,
or do you say not?</p>
<p class="ralign">I.R."</p>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerard laid down the card and regarded,
troubled, his companion's straight shoulders and
the back of his erect head, the only view afforded
as Corrie stood before his mirror employing a
pair of military brushes upon his unruly blond
hair.</p>

<p>"I did not know that the affair&mdash;that matters
were so far arranged between you and your
cousin," he said.</p>

<p>He spoke with hesitation, uncertain of how to
venture upon a subject never before broached
between them, yet feeling speech tacitly invited.
In the stress of his own suffering at the time following
the accident, preoccupied by the witnessing
of Corrie's hard punishment of dishonor and
grief and his struggle to fall no lower under it,
he had forgotten that the boy-man also had to
bear the loss of the girl upon whom he had spent
his first love. For it required no deep insight to
recognize that Isabel Rose was not the type of
woman who is a refuge in time of disaster.</p>

<p>But the embarrassment was his alone; Corrie
answered without confusion:</p>

<p>"We were engaged, yes. But that is ended.
She had no need to write. She might have known,
or have taken it for granted."</p>

<p>Gerard studied the view presented of his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>panion,
striving to draw some conclusion from
pose or tone. He had no mind to have his work
of months marred and his driver distracted by an
interlude of useless sentimentality; the temptation
to congratulate Corrie upon his freedom from
an unsuitable marriage was almost too strong.
But what he actually said was quite different, and
escaped from his lips without consideration of
its effect.</p>

<p>"I should not have supposed your cousin had so
fine and strict a sense of honor."</p>

<p>The oval brush slipped through Corrie's
fingers and fell to the floor, rolling jerkily away
with the light glinting on its silver mounting in
a series of heliographic flashes. The owner
stooped to recover it, groping for the conspicuous
object as if the room were dark instead of flooded
with the brightness of late afternoon.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded. "What
did you say? Her sense of honor&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," Gerard promptly apologized,
aware of worse than indiscretion. "I,
really, Corrie, I hardly realized what I was saying.
Certainly I did not mean that the way it
sounded. I only intended to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>What had he intended to say? What could
he substitute for the spoken truth that would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
wound the hearer either for himself or for the
girl he loved?</p>

<p>"I only meant," he recommenced, "that her
asking your formal release showed a careful punctiliousness
not common."</p>

<p>Corrie had recovered his brush, now. He laid
it on the chiffonier before answering.</p>

<p>"How do we know what is common? What is
honor, anyway; what other people see or what
you are? I fancy she wouldn't have written if
she hadn't been sure of what I'd say," he retorted,
with the first cynicism Gerard ever had seen in
him. "She likes me to take the responsibility, that's
about all. Well, I've done it. Did you say I was
keeping dinner waiting?"</p>

<p>This of the once-adored Isabel! However much
relief the older man felt, there came with it a
sensation of shock and regret. Had Corrie lost
so much of his youth, unsuspected by his daily
companion? Where were the old illusions which
should have blurred this sharp judgment? He
made some brief reply, and presently they went
downstairs.</p>

<p>The dinner was rather a silent affair.</p>

<p>"Do you want to drive me into town?" Gerard
inquired, at its conclusion. "I find that I must
see Carruthers before he leaves for the East, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
he is stopping at the Hotel Marion. If you are
tired, I will get my chauffeur."</p>

<p>"I should like it," Corrie exclaimed, rising
eagerly. "I'll get the car. Your car?"</p>

<p>"I should think so. I am not exactly anxious
to drive into town with your racing machine,
although we have got to make fair time in order
to catch him before his train leaves."</p>

<p>Corrie laughed, turning away.</p>

<p>"I'll make the time, all right," he promised.
"Your roadster isn't so pretty slow, considering.
I'll be at the door in three minutes."</p>

<p>He was, driving hatless and without a motor-mask
in the fresh spring air.</p>

<p>"No overcoat?" Gerard disapproved. "What
would Rupert say?"</p>

<p>Corrie flushed like a complimented girl; that
the mechanician should have admitted him to any
intercourse, however cold and slight, moved him
so deeply that even Gerard's allusion was too much.</p>

<p>"I have it with me; I don't need it," he
evaded hurriedly. "Ready?"</p>

<p>"Ready."</p>

<p>The car sprang forward.</p>

<p>The yellow country road merged into macadam,
the macadam into asphalt. They were in the
city, presently, slowly rolling through streets
filled with playing children who garnered the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
daylight moments. On one corner a hand-organ
was performing, and the group disporting itself
to the flat, tinkling music broke apart to shout
after the car, waving grimy hands.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Corrie!" one shrill voice came to
the motorists.</p>

<p>The driver lifted his hand in salute, glancing
at his companion with a blended mischief and diffidence
so delightful, so much like the old merry
Corrie Rose, that Gerard laughed in sheer sympathy
of pleasure.</p>

<p>"They seem to know you, Corrie?"</p>

<p>"They do. At least, what they call knowing
me. You see, I blew out a tire here, on the way
home after you sent me in to the postoffice, last
week, and about three dozen kiddies gathered
around to watch me change it. Bully little frogs;
they nearly lost all the kit of tools trying to help
me. And talk! So I&mdash;well, I gave them all a
spin about the square, in blocks of as many as
could hang on at a time, and I set up the ice
creams all around. It seemed my treat. You
don't mind? I suppose they <i>are</i> full of germs
and want washing, but I just remembered they
were kids."</p>

<p>"I certainly do not mind," Gerard assured. He
wanted to say something more, but found his
thoughts singularly inarticulate. There was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
certain verse commencing with "Inasmuch&mdash;&mdash;"
that he would have quoted to Corrie, had they
been of any blood but the reticent Saxon. "They
remembered part of your name," he added instead.</p>

<p>"That was all I told them. The Hotel
Marion?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Speed up all you dare, our time is
short."</p>

<p>The time was indeed short. As they came
down the avenue, Gerard uttered an exclamation,
catching sight of a man who descended the hotel
steps toward a carriage.</p>

<p>"Cross the street! There he goes. Quick, or
we'll lose him! Cross over."</p>

<p>He was promptly obeyed. The car shot across
the street regardless of traffic rules, and was
brought shuddering to a halt beside the left-hand
curb. Gerard sprang out and went to join the
man who had stopped beside the carriage to wait
for his pursuer.</p>

<p>Left in the car, Corrie took a leisurely survey
of the street, preparatory to withdrawing from
his illegal situation. But it was already too late.
Even while he looked, a blue-garbed figure appeared
around a corner, perceived the south-bound
automobile beside the east curb and marched upon
the offender.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>To some temperaments there is an undeniable
exhilaration in conflict. Corrie puckered his lips
to a soundless whistle, settled back in his seat, and
waited.</p>

<p>"What are you doing over here?" the officer
challenged, arriving. "Don't you know how to
drive? You're under arrest."</p>

<p>"What for?" Corrie asked unmoved.</p>

<p>"What for? How did you get a chauffeur's
license? For driving on the wrong side of the
street, of course."</p>

<p>"I'm not driving."</p>

<p>"Don't be funny, young fellow! For stopping
on the wrong side, if you like it better, then."</p>

<p>"I'm not stopping."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I am stopped. You did not see me do it. I
might have come out of one of those buildings, or
have come up on one of those sidewalk elevators, for
all you know. You can't arrest me for something
you didn't see me do, man. You wouldn't if you
could; I can see you have a sweet disposition."</p>

<p>The officer stared, and took a more careful
survey of his antagonist.</p>

<p>"You're no chauffeur, I guess," he pronounced
dryly.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got a license."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"That may be. Anyway, chauffeur or college
student, you can't stay here with that machine."</p>

<p>"You want me to leave? Certainly, officer, I
always obey the law. Here comes my friend;
I'll go now."</p>

<p>The policeman's face relaxed into a sour smile,
the nonsense snaring him into unwilling participation.</p>

<p>"Do," he recommended. "The minute your
wheels move, you will be driving on the wrong side
of the street and I will pull you in."</p>

<p>"When I drive on the wrong side of the street,
go ahead and do it. Are you ready to start,
Gerard?"</p>

<p>Gerard, who had come up in time to hear
enough, had interpretation been necessary, put
an additional argument into the man's hand before
entering the car.</p>

<p>"My fault, Johnston," he stated, with the quiet
serenity of one certain of his ground. "You know
I am not a law-breaker, I fancy; this was a case
of necessity."</p>

<p>"It was your friend, Mr. Gerard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Corrie reached for a lever, smiling ingenuously
across as he interrupted to reply.</p>

<p>"The rule says to keep to the right, officer?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I am left-handed, that's all. Now look
at this."</p>

<p>This was the execution of a movement that
sent the automobile rolling backwards.</p>

<p>"You see, I go north on the east side," the
driver called, while the machine slid away. "All
right, yes? Nothing in the rules about which end
first you drive your car? No? I thought not.
Good-by."</p>

<p>The car was at the corner, rounded it, and
darted away in the customary method of straightforward
progression.</p>

<p>"But if this had been New York, I would be
in jail," Corrie added placid commentary, when
security was attained. "I know all about it; I
was arrested in Manhattan, once, for driving
without a license number displayed. The cords
must have broken and have let the number-plate
fall off. Much that policeman listened to me. He
ordered Dean into the tonneau with Flavia,
stepped up into the seat beside me and ordered me
to drive to the nearest police station."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I drove. It cost me twenty-five dollars, a
week later, and I had to 'phone for the family
lawyer with bail to keep me from spending that
night in a cell. Father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>The stop was full. Gerard turned his attention
to the street traffic, giving his companion liberty
to evade continuing the theme. The evasion was
not made.</p>

<p>"Father," Corrie resumed, clearly and steadily,
"gave me this diamond I wear, when I told him,
so that I might always have something with me to
give as a bond for reappearance instead of having
to be locked up until I got help. He said one
might be caught without one's pocketbook along,
but not without one's ring. I have never taken
it off since."</p>

<p>There was a change in his tone that Gerard had
heard before, and never had succeeded in analyzing;
not the change from gayety to gravity,
although that was present, but some more subtle
alteration that stirred the hearer to a strange,
illogical sense of discomfort and failure on his own
part. The feeling was transient and most unreasonable;
common-sense swept it aside almost
as it was formed. He said nothing, nor did his
companion speak again.</p>

<p>The sunset glow and color were gone, but the
delicate after-light still remained as a luminous
presence in the land when the automobile entered
the boundaries of the Mercury Company's property.
There was a gate before the private road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
to Allan Gerard's house. When Corrie halted the
car there and descended to open the way, a ragged,
unsavory figure rose from the grass before him.</p>

<p>"I'll open it, mister," the man volunteered.
"Never mind it," as Corrie felt in his pocket for
coin. "I want more than that. Forgotten me,
have you?"</p>

<p>Astonished, Corrie scrutinized him, seeking the
recollection implied.</p>

<p>"You're the man in the <i>Dear Me</i>!" he identified
suddenly. "The man I threw overboard."</p>

<p>"Ah! You're it." He drew nearer, blinking
intelligence. "I served you a square turn for
your grub and clothes, too. Get rid of your
friend; you an' me has got to talk."</p>

<p>Before the bearing of confident familiarity, the
unclean personality and significant smile, Corrie
slowly stiffened in rigid distaste.</p>

<p>"What do you want to say to me?" he demanded
curtly. "What do you mean by serving
me a square turn? Speak out. There is nothing
concerning me that my friend doesn't already
know."</p>

<p>The man projected his unshaven chin, cunningly
interrogative. The intervening months had altered
him, not pleasantly. The tramp of the <i>Dear Me</i>
had been unattractive; this man was repellent.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is he on to what happened on the day before
the last Cup race? Given him the inside story
of that, have you? Or was he there?"</p>

<p>The pause was not noticeably long.</p>

<p>"He is Allan Gerard," said Corrie, his voice
suppressed. "Say what you wish."</p>

<p>"I saw you ridin' past without a hat on, a
while ago, an' I knew you. Want? I want you
to stand somethin' for me to live on, Mr. Rose,
you bein' a millionaire. I was on the spot after
the smash an' heard the talk an' saw your wrench
picked up. You'd treated me right, so I just
lifted a bunch of tools from one of the machines
standin' empty, an' sprinkled them around that
twelve-mile race track. The newspaper fellows
found the things, too, an' kind of thought less
of findin' the one where you smashed Mr. Gerard.
One fellow help another, eh? No use of goin' to
Sing Sing, neither."</p>

<p>Corrie's movement was swiftly accurate and uncalculated
as the leap of some enraged primitive
creature. His ungloved fist struck with an impact
sounding like the slap of an open hand, and
flung the man crashing through the hedge of lilac-bushes
to roll over and over on the ground, clutching
blindly at the turf strewn with broken leaf-buds.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Corrie!" Gerard cried stern warning, too late,
starting from his seat.</p>

<p>Corrie swung about, his blue eyes blazing in
his flushed face, his lips parted in a scarlet line
across the white gleam of his set teeth.</p>

<p>"If he comes near me again, I'll <i>kill</i> him!" he
panted savagely.</p>

<p>"It seems to me you have done enough of that
sort of thing, already," Gerard retorted, equally
angered.</p>

<p>The biting reminder was not premeditated; it
leaped out of brief wrath and all the aching
memories stirred by the episode. But it was none
the less effective. Gerard himself did not realize
how effective until he saw all the color and animation
wiped from the young face and saw Corrie
put his hand across his eyes.</p>

<p>"Corrie!" he exclaimed, cut deeply by his own
cruelty, amazedly furious with himself. "Corrie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Corrie had turned his back to him, not in offence,
but as a woman would cover her face. He
answered without moving.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;all right. I understand; it is&mdash;all
right."</p>

<p>Gerard left the car, more humiliated in his own
sight than he ever had been in his life. For the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
moment his own lack of self-control loomed larger
than Corrie's, past or present.</p>

<p>"Corrie, I said what I did not mean," he appealed,
laying his hand on the other's shoulder.
"Forgive me. Don't take it like this!"</p>

<p>Corrie slowly turned to him.</p>

<p>"There isn't anything you can say to me, that
I can complain of," he checked apology, quietly
serious. "It is all right, of course. I&mdash;no one
can understand just what it was like to hear him
talk that way to me, no one can, ever. But I
should not have struck him."</p>

<p>The expression in his eyes as they encountered
Gerard's was not of remorse or shame, or resentment,
was not any mingling of these, but simply
of utter loneliness patiently accepted. Gerard
stood back in silence, helplessly aware of having
inflicted a hurt no contrition could heal.</p>

<p>The man was sitting up, dazed and bruised, his
stupid gaze following his assailant. To him Corrie
went, dragging forth a handful of paper money.</p>

<p>"Keep away from me," the victor cautioned
with harsh dislike. "I mean it. Here, take this
and go. I'm giving it to you because I knocked
you down and not because of anything you claim,
understand."</p>

<p>The man grasped the money eagerly, peering
up with more admiration than sullenness.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've got a good punch, mister," he conceded.
"I'll get out. I wouldn't have come, only
I thought you'd really done what they said, that
time."</p>

<p>Corrie drew back sharply, staring at the other.
His right hand was cut and bleeding from the
blow he had dealt, red drops trickled and fell as he
stood, but he did not seem aware of the fact, either
then or when he turned away to take his place at
the steering-wheel. Gerard took the seat beside
him without comment; he fancied he could imagine
very exactly what Corrie Rose, gentleman, was
enduring.</p>

<p>But whatever Corrie had to endure then or at
any time, he was quite masculine enough to hurry
it out of sight. At the house, he turned to Gerard
his usual matter-of-fact glance.</p>

<p>"I will put the car in the garage and go over
to the factory for a while," he said. "Mr. Edwards
was going to examine that throttle which
jarred open&mdash;on the Titan, I mean&mdash;so it would
be ready for me to start early to-morrow. I told
him I would be over, this evening."</p>

<p>"As you like. But do not stay too long; the
house is lonely without you. And, do something
for that cut hand, Corrie, or it may make you
trouble."</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," acknowledged the younger.</p>

<p>The Titan was ready next morning, as due,
and the early start was made.</p>

<p>The great machine had run for several days
without especial incident, but this morning Devlin's
nervous incompetency manifested itself in a new
direction. He forgot to fill the oil-tank of the
car he served as mechanician, before Corrie took
it out. One of the testers drove into the busy
courtyard, about ten o'clock, shouting the information
that the Titan was stuck eight miles out on
the back road and Rose wanted the emergency car
to bring him oil.</p>

<p>Sardonic of eye, caustic of tongue, Rupert himself
attended to the carrying out of the request
and watched the rescuing car depart on its mission.
Half an hour later the Titan rolled past, missing
fire and running with a sound like a sick gatling
gun. Bare-headed and without his mask, Corrie
was driving with one hand and striving to aid his
mechanician's efforts with the other, as they swept
around the mile track. In gritting exasperation
Rupert stared after them, then snatched up a
red flag and ran to the edge of the road.</p>

<p>Gerard, notified of trouble with the big car,
arrived from his office in time to see the Titan
halt, flagged, and the lightning strike Devlin.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Get out," snarled Rupert, his dark face black
with scorn, swinging one small arm in a wide
gesture. "I ain't had any explanation of what
you're doing behind anything except a baby-carriage,
and I don't want it. Get out and don't
come back. Quick!"</p>

<p>Dazed, Devlin obeyed. Rupert dragged open
the motor's hood, busied himself for thirty
seconds and crashed the metal cover shut again.
As he flung himself into the seat beside the stupefied
Corrie, he first caught sight of Gerard standing
on the stone portal.</p>

<p>"Better send someone to hold down the yard,"
he sharply advised. "I ain't going to be there.
What?"</p>

<p>Corrie had sufficient presence of tact to send
the car forward without pause or comment, not
daring to look at his new companion. But he
gathered a jumbled view of Gerard's mirthful
face and of Devlin standing sulkily at bay before
his grinning mates.</p>

<p>When the Mercury Titan returned from its
morning's work, it was running with the velvet
purr of a happy tiger, the flames from its exhausts
shimmered in the violet tints of perfect mixture,
and the indicating dial pointed to the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Corrie had found some stretch of road where he
had passed the hundred mile an hour gait.</p>

<p>"She's in exact shape," approved Gerard, who
had come out to meet them. "Good work,
Rupert."</p>

<p>Rupert turned a hard dark eye upon him.</p>

<p>"I ain't pining for this," he signified measuredly.
"But there's something coming to any
decent car, and this one's suffered cruel."</p>

<p>Gerard nodded.</p>

<p>"I have been wondering where I could find a
mechanician fit to race with Corrie this season,"
he confided, nonchalantly serene.</p>

<p>The double bombshell dealt full effect.</p>

<p>"Well, rest yourself," urged Rupert tartly,
leaving his seat. "I'll do it. I know I'm a liar,
I guess, but that won't hurt my work none."</p>

<p>"Race?" gasped Corrie. "Race? <i>I!</i>"</p>

<p>One rebel vanquished utterly, Gerard surveyed
the other, preparing for his first conflict with
the new Corrie Rose he had himself created; the
Corrie Rose who in his twentieth year was a full-grown
man.</p>

<p>"I have had you and the car entered for the
Indianapolis meet, next month," he announced;
"after that we are going to Georgia, then down
to try the sea-beach along the Florida shore, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
you can let out all the speed the machine has got.
Of course you will race. What else have you
been training for?"</p>

<p>Corrie's full red lips closed, his blue eyes braved
Gerard's.</p>

<p>"I will not. Gerard, I cannot. To go back
as the millionaire amateur of the pink car, to
stand the toleration of the professional drivers,
who cannot really handle their machines better
than I can mine, to know that the story of how
you were wrecked is being whispered after me&mdash;I'm
not big enough to face it all! I might be
challenged and sent off the track, for all I know."</p>

<p>"You will not go back as an amateur," Gerard
corrected. "You are entered and registered as a
professional automobile racer, enrolled on the
books of the A.M.A., under their protection and
subject to their rules and authority for the future.
You will find your certificate of the fact lying on
your table. Yes, I did it without consulting you.
You signed the necessary papers yourself, without
reading them, and you cannot undo this without
a formal resignation&mdash;unless you contrive to
get yourself suspended."</p>

<p>Corrie's fingers gripped the wheel, the varying
expressions changing his face like storm-swept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
water, while the hunger of his gaze besought
Gerard.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;it's <i>true</i>? Gerard, you've done <i>that</i>
for me? They, the A.M.A. officers, they accepted
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Once for all, there are no whispers connecting
you with my accident. That matter is
dead. You go back to the racing as a recognized
driver in the employ of the Mercury Company, I
acting as your manager and Jack Rupert as your
mechanician. Do you think it probable that anyone
would credit the idea of trouble between us,
Corrie?"</p>

<p>"Give me a moment, or I'll lose the only honor
I've kept," said Corrie Rose, and turned away
his face. "I shall do whatever you bid me,
of course."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>XIV</h2>
<h3>VAL DE ROSAS</h3>

<p>On the day that Corrie in his American home
consented to drive the Mercury Titan through the
racing season, Flavia and Mr. Rose arrived at the
tiny Spanish village of Val de Rosas&mdash;arrived,
not so much through design as through the bursting
of a tire on their motor car.</p>

<p>"It seems as if the name of the place might be
one of our lost titles," observed Mr. Rose idly.
"And there is the castle to match, on the hillside.
Come stroll through the town, my girl, while
Lenoir repairs damages."</p>

<p>Smiling, Flavia stepped down beside him, throwing
back her silk veils and lifting her fair, almost
too delicate face to the Andalusian sunshine. After
her stepped a great dog, with the sedate, matter-of-course
bearing of a constant attendant.</p>

<p>"I wonder who lives in the castle," she responded
to his mood of playfulness. "<i>Our</i> castle.
We should dispossess them."</p>

<p>"Lets," proposed her father.</p>

<p>There was an inn in the village, kept by a
ravishingly plump landlord of sixty who wore a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
short velvet jacket. He informed the travellers
that the diminutive white castle was not only
vacant, but to let, being the property of a mad
Englishman who had bought it to live in while
writing a book, and having finished the book had
departed. Mr. Rose regarded his daughter speculatively.</p>

<p>"We have been going from one place to another
for five months, and we have got to put in six
more," he said with brief decisiveness. "I mean
to stay on this side of the water until fall. Do
you want to try living here for a while, or would
you rather keep moving?"</p>

<p>"Let us stay here," Flavia voted eagerly.
"Dear, I am so tired of hotels."</p>

<p>Mr. Rose studied her as she stood, slim and
frail, before him, her large eyes fixed on his.</p>

<p>"I guess we are tired of more than that, you
and I," he pronounced. "But I'll run up and see
if the place can be made fit to live in. You had
better rest here, in the shade; Frederick will take
care of you and Lenoir is within call. Here,
se&ntilde;or, set a chair here under these trees."</p>

<p>She moved to the seat placed for her by the
deferential host, and watched her father's departure
up the winding road. They were both
thinking of Corrie, lacking whom all places were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
blank, with whom, in one winter's enthusiasm, they
had studied this soft Spanish tongue they now
used without him. They had planned a trip to
Puerto Rico, then, that never had been taken. But
Flavia also was thinking of Allan Gerard&mdash;Allan
Gerard, who loved Isabel and for whose sake Flavia
carried a double sorrow, his and her own. As he
had found excuses in his mind for her apparent
failure of him, so she on her part never had blamed
him for what she considered her own misunderstanding
of his purpose. They were not given to
the small vice of ready condemnation. There is
no comfort in blaming the one loved, where the
love is great.</p>

<p>A murmur of wondering dismay aroused Flavia
from her musing, a sound scarcely louder than
the murmur of the bees busied among the heavy
waxen-white lemon-blossoms overhead. She lifted
her chin from her hand, and saw a brown-haired,
brown-skinned, brown-eyed girl standing on the
path, gazing at the huge dog that barred her
passage.</p>

<p>"Pray do not be frightened," Flavia begged.
"Come here, Frederick! Indeed, he is only a
young dog and very gentle."</p>

<p>"He is very large, se&ntilde;orita," the girl smiled,
half-reassured, half-fearful. "He bites, no?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, indeed. See."</p>

<p>"He loves the se&ntilde;orita. That does not surprise,"
with Latin grace of compliment.</p>

<p>Flavia smiled, too, drawing the Great Dane's
bulky head against her knee.</p>

<p>"I love him, perhaps."</p>

<p>"One sees it, since he voyages with the se&ntilde;ores
in that splendid automobile, where a man might
find place with joy."</p>

<p>A wistfulness in the comment moved the listener
to give explanation, almost in apology for lavishing
upon an animal what might have rejoiced a
human being.</p>

<p>"He is my brother's dog. But my brother
went away, and the poor dog grieved for him
all the time, except with me. I could not leave
him to fret, without either of us, so he came abroad,
too."</p>

<p>"Across the ocean, se&ntilde;orita?"</p>

<p>"Across the ocean. From America."</p>

<p>The two young girls considered one another in
a pause full of cordial sympathy. Different in
race, station and experience, the bond of maidenhood
drew them to each other with delicate lines
of mutual comprehension and accord.</p>

<p>"It is the dog's name which is on the great
silver-and-leather collar, or the name of the
se&ntilde;orita?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Flavia's small fair hand guided the plump
brown one tracing the legend upon the massive
band.</p>

<p>"'<i>Federigo el Grande, que pertenece &aacute; Corwin
Basil Rose, Long Island</i>,'" she translated.</p>

<p>"Don Corwin&mdash;that does not say itself easily!"</p>

<p>"We called him Corrie."</p>

<p>"Ah, that I can say; Don Corrie."</p>

<p>The soft household name sounded yet softer in
the Andalusian accents. Flavia looked away, feeling
her lips quiver.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me your name?" she asked, by
way of diversion. "Mine is Flavia Rose. Perhaps
we shall see more of each other, if I stay
here and you do also."</p>

<p>"I am called Elvira Paredes, se&ntilde;orita. And I
shall be here&mdash;I cannot go for so long, so long,
perhaps never."</p>

<p>Flavia leaned forward, her clear eyes questioning.</p>

<p>"You want to go away? To leave this place
for some other?"</p>

<p>The confidence came with an outrush of feeling,
a wealth of expression and expressive gestures.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita, to join my betrothed. Ah, there
never was one like him, so beautiful, so brave, so
constant like the sun in rising! You cannot know.
No one can know who has not seen it. And sing!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Under my window he would sing until the birds
would hush, hush to listen. I have no marriage-portion,
I who am an orphan living with the sister
of my mother's cousin. Not for that did Luis
hesitate. But the time came when he must do
military service; serve in Morocco, se&ntilde;orita, serve
among savages who would torture him! And to
come back poor as he went. So he left. Far away
he journeyed, to New York, which is in America,
to find peace and make a home."</p>

<p>"Where you will go to him?"</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita, we hope it. He works, I wait. We
write long letters. But it is three years. It costs
much to cross the ocean, and one grows old." The
brown eyes looked the tragedy of hope deferred.</p>

<p>"For men must work and women must
weep&mdash;&mdash;" The old refrain came to Flavia.
But not this woman, not if her American sister
could prevent. And the preventing was so easy!
She drew the girl down on the seat beside her,
impulsive as Corrie could have been.</p>

<p>"Listen, Elvira&mdash;I may call you Elvira? Let
me help you. I have so much money, so much
more than I can spend, and I am not very happy.
Let me think that I have given you what I cannot
have; let me send you to Luis. My father will
tell us how, he will arrange everything so that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
will not have to trouble at all. We will send a
message to Luis so that he may meet you."</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita!"</p>

<p>"You will let me? You will not say no? Why,
Elvira!"</p>

<p>The girl dropped her face in Flavia's lap and
burst into hysterical tears, covering her hands
with kisses.</p>

<p>When Mr. Rose returned, half an hour later,
this time in the big automobile whose rushing passage
stirred whirlwinds of dust on the age-old
road, his daughter met him eagerly.</p>

<p>"Papa, I want to send Elvira Paredes to
America, to her fianc&eacute;e. She is a kinswoman of the
inn-keeper, here. Will you arrange it for us? I
think she would be frightened if you sent her by
first-class, but second-class would be very nice.
She knows how to go in the train to Malaga, if
you get the ticket, and ships sail from there, do
they not? Oh, and would you cable to Luis
C&aacute;rdenas, in New York, so he will know she is
coming? I will find the street and number from
Elvira."</p>

<p>His children long since had trained Mr. Rose to
be surprised at no charming vagaries. He contemplated
Flavia, amused, and well pleased with
her animation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Found something to play with, eh? Very
good, we will fix it. But your Elvira will have to
wait until I get an answer from her lover through
the cable company; I'm sending no girls to New
York without knowing they'll land in the right
hands. Now, I believe that house up there will
suit. We'll have some luncheon and then drive
up for you to see it. I like the place, myself. It
opens well."</p>

<p>It opened well, if the happiness of Elvira
Paredes was a good augury.</p>

<p>"All the rest is from my father," Flavia said, in
parting from her. "But take this from me, to
wear or for a marriage portion, as you choose."</p>

<p>The gift was a sapphire ring slipped from
Flavia's slim finger.</p>

<p>"It resembles the eyes of the se&ntilde;orita; may
they always be as bright and clear," fervently
returned Elvira, who was an Andalusian and therefore
a poet.</p>

<p>"That cost some money, when I bought it,"
Mr. Rose practically observed, from his seat in
the motor-car. "Tell her not to flash it in New
York, alone, if she wants to keep it. You can put
that into classic Spanish for me, my girl."</p>

<p>That was the beginning of an interlude whose
placid monotony was tempered by much equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
placid incident. The Americans liked the village,
and the village rejoiced in the Americans, so that
they came to know each other very well. More
than once Flavia thought of the legend of Al-Mansor,
and that if one of these days could be
deemed happy enough to record by a pearl, the
vase could be filled with the gem-chronicles, so
much alike were the weeks.</p>

<p>For the white castle on the hill kept its visitors,
and so it happened that the summer most crowded
and busy of any Corrie ever had known, slipped
drowsily by in drowsy Val de Rosas for the two
most interested in him.</p>

<p>He never told Flavia what he was doing. The
new Corrie Rose was more considerate than the
self-centred thoughtlessness of youth had permitted
the boy Corrie to be. He would have remembered
her anxiety for his safety and dread of
danger for him, of himself, but his silence was
further impelled by Gerard, who had pointed out&mdash;in
a few brief sentences that avoided Flavia's
name&mdash;the responsibility she must feel in keeping
such a secret from her father. But, because it
was so difficult to write to his "Other Fellow"
without telling her all, Corrie's letters came with
greater intervals and were less in length.</p>

<p>"I am still touring with Gerard," he wrote to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Flavia, in the last note of his that came to Val de
Rosas. "Don't mind if my letters come slower,
please; I am pretty busy. I guess you will understand
what it means to me when I can say that I
am doing some work for Gerard and that he calls
it good. I wish it cost me more to do. I hope
father is well; you didn't say, last time. Keep
on writing often, you know, it's the next thing to
seeing you."</p>

<p>He wrote that note the night after he broke a
track record in California, wrote it on the chiffonier
of the hotel bedroom while making ready
to attend a motor club dinner at which he was to
be chief guest in honor of the day's event. Four
weeks later Flavia read it, under the flowering
almond trees that surrounded the house so closely
as to overhang the balcony on which she sat. Read
it, then kissed the careless, boyish <i>Corwin B. Rose</i>
that slanted crookedly across the foot of the page.
Holding the letter, she sat quite still.</p>

<p>From the room within drifted the voices of Mr.
Rose and the mild Father Bartolom&eacute;, between
whom the last months had established a cordial
basis of esteem. The village priest had dined with
them; it was in deference to his presence that
Flavia wore a gown whose lace collar came up
to her round chin, and now had left the two gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>men
to after-dinner conversation instead of herself
entertaining her father. She had the sense of
being horribly alone; her longing for Corrie became
physical pain, so that she crushed the letter
in her fingers, catching her breath with difficulty.
Close to one another they always had been, still
closer together trouble had drawn them, but now
half the world stretched its empty spaces between.
The impulse that goaded her was to cry out to her
father that she must see Corrie&mdash;to take her to
him&mdash;yet she did not speak or move, resolute in
endurance. To make that appeal to her father
would be to separate Corrie from Allan Gerard,
she knew, to bring her brother back to the
atmosphere of constraint and reproach to escape
which he had left the rose-colored Long Island
villa they called home.</p>

<p>"Taxes are taxes," Mr. Rose's raised accents
set forth. "Governments have to be maintained.
If the tax collector is due to-morrow, Val de Rosas
has got to pay up."</p>

<p>There was a murmured reply in the softer tones.</p>

<p>"No money?" the American echoed. "I suppose
I could guess that." There came the crisp
sound of parting paper. "Now, if you will make
a figure for the total, Father, I'll give you this
check to pay for the whole thing. I've lived in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
town five months, and I like the people&mdash;it's my
treat. No, I haven't counted the chickens and
measured the houses, but I can see the amount
isn't exactly ruinous. Now, we won't talk any
more about it; here you are."</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or Rose," solemnly said the old man, with
inexpressible dignity and authority,&mdash;Flavia heard
him rise,&mdash;"this will be repaid by the One to
Whom you lend through the poor&mdash;repaid to you,
and to your daughter."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"You might include my son in that; I've got
one, you know," suggested Thomas Rose, carefully
casual.</p>

<p>Flavia covered her eyes, and the tears trickled
through her slender fingers.</p>

<p>When the moon was up and the pant of a
distant motor announced that the guest was being
conveyed to the village by Lenoir and the big automobile,
Flavia went in to her father. Both of
them maintained their usual composure, as they
smiled at one another across the room, but the
young girl's extreme pallor was not to be disguised
when she came into the light. Mr. Rose looked
at her, and continued to look.</p>

<p>"You're not well, my girl," he asserted, concerned.
"Never mind drawing that curtain; come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
over here. Don't you think it's time to tell me
why you sent off Gerard? I know how hard it
must have hit him, when he was down already,
and I've felt sorry often enough, but a man has
to take a woman's answer and I've said nothing.
But I believed at home that you liked him, and I
believe you have been fretting ever since."</p>

<p>Flavia grasped the heavy curtain, gazing at him
in an utter confusion of thought that amounted to
actual giddiness.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I sent away Mr. Gerard?" she marvelled.</p>

<p>"Who else? Or if you accepted him, why was
I not told?"</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what you mean?" she asked
brokenly.</p>

<p>"Mean? I mean that the last time I saw
Allan Gerard alone, on the day I met you and
Corrie driving home together, he asked my permission
to propose to you. I rather guess that
hour with him didn't make me very easy on Corrie,
although I was given no cause to be otherwise by
Gerard. Gerard said frankly that he wouldn't
have offered you such a wreck as he felt himself,
much as he loved you, if he had not gone so far
before he was hurt that he had no right to leave
in silence. He said that as a matter of honorable
justice he must lay the decision before you and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
abide by your will. Very quiet, he was&mdash;I told
him that I would rather give you to him than to
any other man on earth, and I meant it."</p>

<p>The room blurred before Flavia's dilated eyes.</p>

<p>"You never told me! Papa, you never told
me!"</p>

<p>The passionate cry of grief brought Mr. Rose
to his feet.</p>

<p>"Told you? Gerard was to tell you. I wanted
to carry him home with me that afternoon, but he
refused. In fact, he was not fit, nor I either, to
stand any more sentiment just then. He said he
would write and ask you to see him, if you cared
to have him speak or come back at all. That trip
West he had to take. Didn't he write?"</p>

<p>She saw the softly-lighted little room at home
where Jack Rupert had come to her, and Isabel's
suffused, desperate face as she snatched the letter
from its owner. And as a pendant picture she saw
the bleak, solitary railway station in the gray
December morning, where Gerard, ill and reft of
his splendid strength, had waited alone for the
girl who did not come.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose reached her as she swayed forward.</p>

<p>"Take me home," she gasped, clinging to him
with small fierce hands. "I never knew. Dear,
take me home."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning they left Val de Rosas.</p>

<p>It is a long journey from Andalusia to New
York. But it was on the morning they boarded
the ocean liner that Mr. Rose purchased a New
York journal&mdash;and met a news item that gave
him material for thought during the rest of the
trip. The item was on the sporting page, and
stated that the Cup race course was now open for
practice; among the first of the cars to commence
training being the Mercury Titan, driven by Corrie
Rose&mdash;one of the cleverest young professionals
in America, whose work with the Mercury Company's
special racing machine had given the
greatest satisfaction to its owner and designer,
Mr. Allan Gerard.</p>

<p>There was no longer any cause for concealment.
When Mr. Rose carried the journal to
Flavia, she told him quite simply to whom Corrie
had gone in his exile and what she knew of his
life with Gerard. Of his racing she herself had
been left ignorant; she could guess whose forgiving
tenderness had spared her that anxiety.</p>

<p>"You are not angry with Corrie," she ventured,
before her father's knit brow and squared jaw.
"You did not forbid him to race or he would not
have done so, I am sure."</p>

<p>"No, I did not. I didn't think I had to," was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the dry response. "Angry? He and I are past
that. The days are gone when we used to have
our differences and shake hands on them. We'll
get along together quietly enough, I dare say."</p>

<p>"Now, I would rather you said you were
angry," she grieved.</p>

<p>Thomas Rose thrust his hands into his pockets,
looking down at the newspaper page. He had
altered during the last year in a way difficult to
characterize. It was not that he looked older or
more hard, there was no bitterness in the strong
face, but he looked like a man who stood in the
shadow instead of in the sun.</p>

<p>"So would Corrie, I fancy," he said heavily.</p>

<p>Corrie's sister folded her hands in her lap.</p>

<p>"Is there no chance if one falls once?" she
rebelled in futile reproach. "He was so young,
he has suffered so much&mdash;can he never pay?"</p>

<p>"I'm not much of a reader, as a rule, but I
did a good deal of it at Val de Rosas, this summer,"
Mr. Rose slowly returned. "And a line from an
Englishman's work stuck in my memory. He
said that tears can wash out guilt, but not shame.
I can give Corrie all I've got, I have always been
fond of him and I am yet, but I can't give him my
respect. It was a shameful thing to strike down
an unprepared man from behind, because he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
losing in a game. Some things can't be paid for,
because they are not bought and sold. Of course
he will have every chance possible. He isn't what
I supposed; well, there is no use of complaining,
we will make the best of what he is. I sent him
away while we settled down to living on the new
basis; I guess we are as ready to go on, now, as
we ever will be."</p>

<p>"If he heard you say that, I think he would
die," she stated her hopeless conviction.</p>

<p>"People don't die so easily, my girl. I tell you
he and I will get along well enough. Pass me
those books over there."</p>

<p>Flavia obeyed, having no words. Mr. Rose sat
down and compared the date of the steamer's
probable arrival with that of the Cup race.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>XV</h2>
<h3>THE STRENGTH OF TEN</h3>

<p>It had required more than eloquence or tact,
it had required actual compulsion to bring Corrie
Rose back to race at Long Island. All his successful
work, all the cordiality that met him wherever
he went, and the temptation to essay new conquest,
failed to overcome his repugnance. But he could
not defy Gerard.</p>

<p>"I don't see how <i>you</i> can bear to look at the
place," he had flung, in his final defeat.</p>

<p>"My dear Corrie, I am not any further from
that here than there," Gerard had quietly replied.</p>

<p>Corrie understood, and submitted dumbly thereafter.
And, in spite of himself, his first day's
practice on the course swept everything aside
except eager exhilaration. He was too superbly
healthy for morbidity, too masculine for continuous
dwelling in memories; if Gerard had not been
very certain of that fact, he would never have
brought his ward there. When Corrie was driving,
Corrie was happy. He drove with a sober intensity
of devotion, his passion was serious,
whereas Gerard had raced fire-ardent and won or
lost laughing.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a small hotel near the course which
the motor-men had made a rendezvous. Here
Gerard established his party, during the two
weeks of practice work. He did not choose to
have Corrie in New York, although Rupert chafed
and he himself was obliged to go in to the city
frequently, at considerable inconvenience.</p>

<p>On the last afternoon before the race, he returned
from such a trip, and arrived before the
hotel just as Corrie rolled up with the Mercury
Titan and halted it opposite him.</p>

<p>"It's five o'clock," the driver explained, stilling
his roaring motor and leaning out. "Everyone
is coming in, to get ready for to-morrow."</p>

<p>There was little trace left of the petulant,
gaudily dressed boy who a year before had driven
the pink car, in this serious young professional
clad in the Mercury's racing gray and bearing
the Mercury's silver insignia on his shoulder. The
bend of his mouth was firmer, his dark-blue eyes
had acquired the steady, all-embracing keenness
of Gerard's&mdash;the gaze of all those men with whom
the inopportune flicker of an eyelid may mean
destruction. He was clothed with his virile youth
as with a radiant garment, as he smiled across at
Gerard.</p>

<p>"Yes, get some rest; you will be out at dawn,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
approved Gerard, coming closer. "Where is
Rupert? What is the matter, Corrie? You look
disturbed."</p>

<p>"Rupert got off at the corner, back there. I
suppose if I look rattled, that <i>he</i> is what is the
matter. He&mdash;&mdash;" Corrie suddenly dropped his
face in his folded arms as they rested upon the
steering-wheel, his shoulders shaking.</p>

<p>"He? How? He has been talking to you?"</p>

<p>"He sure has been talking to me," Corrie
affirmed, lifting his laughter-flushed face. "When
I think that he once gave me the silence treatment!
His tongue would take the starch out of
a Chinese laundry and make a taxicab chauffeur
feel he couldn't drive."</p>

<p>"You do not let him talk to you when you are
driving!"</p>

<p>"Oh, when I am driving he is the perfect
mechanician. He wouldn't open his lips if I hit
a right-angle turn at ninety miles an hour or
disobey if I told him to climb out and cut the
tires off the rear wheels. No, it is when I am not
officially driving that he gives me some remarks
to study about. Good pointers, too! I like it,
really. I only wish," his expression shadowed
abruptly, "I only wish I didn't have to remember
that nothing could bring him to shake hands with
me."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Corrie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I beg your pardon for speaking of
that to you. But, Gerard," he bent to grasp a
lever, "I'd take what you got last year, I'd consent
to be picked up dead from under my car
to-morrow, if I could that way buy one hour to
stand clean before you and Jack Rupert. That's
all&mdash;don't think I want to flinch, please. If you
will go on in, I'll put this machine away and be
back to dinner in fifteen minutes. I see Rupert
coming to help me, now. We're starved to death
and some tired. By the way, George shouted
over to me that he would be in as soon as he got
the Duplex canned for the night, and to order a
few dozen eggs and a couple of hams fried for him.
Would you attend to it on your way in?"</p>

<p>"I surely would," Gerard answered, the great
gentleness of his tone mating oddly with the light
words. "What do you want ordered for yourself?"</p>

<p>"Anything, and plenty of it."</p>

<p>Gerard did not smile as he went into the building.
He too would have given much to spare
Corrie Rose the memory of that October morning's
fault. From all punishment except that memory
he had sheltered him, further aid no one could
give. But because he loved Corrie, he climbed the
hotel stairs in slow abstraction and failed to per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ceive
the limousine that came up before the Mercury
Titan, and stopped.</p>

<p>He was standing by a table in the empty parlor
of the hotel, when the door opened, and closed.
Thinking some other guest had entered, he did not
turn from the letters he was reading, nor was there
any further movement or demand upon his attention.
That which slowly invaded his consciousness
was a summons more delicate than sound, a faint,
distinctive flower-fragrance that proclaimed one
individual presence. Flavia Rose was in the room;
he knew it before he swung around and saw her
standing there.</p>

<p>The shock that leaped along his pulses was less
of hope than of renewed pain.</p>

<p>"Miss Rose!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>She moved a little forward. Against her dark
velvet gown, under her wide velvet hat, her soft,
earnest face showed whitely lustrous and irradiated,
her beautiful eyes dwelt on his.</p>

<p>"I never knew," she said, her clear voice like
rippled water. "Your letter, the night before you
went away, never came to me. I never knew you
had sent for me, until last month."</p>

<p>The movement that brought Gerard across the
room was as nakedly passionate as the incoherent
simplicity of her speech.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"You never knew? Flavia, you would have
come?"</p>

<p>"I would have come; I wanted to come long
before, while you were so ill&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They had waited a year on the verge of that
moment; it was enough to touch one another in
this security of understanding. There was no
question between them, no doubt, now that they
saw each other face to face; all their world flowered
into light and fragrance, present and future
one dazzling marvel.</p>

<p>But at last they drew slightly apart, gazing at
each other with an incredulity of such happiness,
both Flavia's little hands held in the firm clasp
of Gerard's left. And then gradually awoke
amazement that they could ever have been
separated, who were so closely bound together.</p>

<p>"My dear, my dear, you knew I loved you," he
wondered. "How did this happen to us?"</p>

<p>"How could I know? You had never said it."</p>

<p>"Did I need to? I thought the very stones in
the fountain arcade must have seen it. And I
trusted Rupert with the letter; he said he had
given it to you, he even brought an answer."</p>

<p>"Do not blame him," she quickly defended.
"He told you that he had given it to Miss Rose;
he meant to Isabel, who claimed it."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your cousin? What had I to do with her?
Why should I have written to her? Have written
<i>that</i>, Flavia!"</p>

<p>The tears rushed to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Your letter&mdash;Allan, if I had known that message
was for me, I would have gone back with
Rupert to you that evening. But Isabel took it,
for some reason she expected a message from you,
that night. I have not been able to understand
that, although I have tried ever since papa told
me, last month, that it was I whom you chose. She
spoke of something Corrie had said. I&mdash;I think
she believed you did care for her more seriously
than she had meant you should. She was so very
sure the letter was for her&mdash;and you did not call
me Flavia once."</p>

<p>"I had no right, I dared not. Dear, I had had
a bad month; I did not remember that any Miss
Rose but you existed. I used to close my eyes,
when things were worst, and see your eyes against
the dark. There were days when I did not see
much else. But they were not so bad, no day ever
was so bad as the morning Corrie came to the
station without you. Forgive me, I hurt you!"</p>

<p>She shook her fair head, wordless. Quiet from
the very vehemence of feeling that possessed them
both, Gerard stooped and kissed her.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you marry me soon, Flavia? After this
race, when Corrie can be with us? Let us waste
no more time apart; I have wanted you so long,
so very long."</p>

<p>The lovely color flushed her transparent face,
but her fingers clung to his.</p>

<p>"All the way home from Spain, I have been
remembering that I really was betrothed to you
this whole year," she answered, not turning from
him the innocent candor of her clear gaze. "Before
that, before I knew the truth, I used to think
how strange a thing it would have been if you had
died in the accident and I had lived all the rest
of my life believing myself promised to you, when
in fact you had loved Isabel, not me. I used to
think, often, of that first day when I fell on the
stairs at the Beach race track&mdash;when you caught
me and held me close to you&mdash;and how you would
never again hold me like that or miss not doing
so. I am quite sure that no one ever was wanted
so much as I have wanted you. It may not be
right to tell this even to you, but it is true. And I
will marry you whenever you ask, Allan."</p>

<p>Allan Gerard, man of the practical world and
the twentieth century, went to his knee on the
floor of the hotel parlor and hid his face against
her hand.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>The room was rosy with the glow of sunset,
when someone discreetly knocked. In response to
Gerard's invitation to enter, the door opened and
revealed the wiry, jersey-clad form of Rupert on
the threshold. Grimy yet from his recent employment,
he was engaged in deftly winding a
strip of antiseptic gauze around his wrist while he
spoke.</p>

<p>"I ain't one to invite li'l' Artha' Brownskin to
meet the A.M.A. on Sunday," he began discontentedly,
and broke off at sight of Flavia.</p>

<p>"I don't need to introduce you to Miss Rose,"
smiled Gerard. "What have you done to your
wrist? Much?"</p>

<p>"Scratched it threading my sewing-machine;
I'll be able to sit up in bed to-morrow," reassured
the mechanician, his acute black eyes travelling
from the young girl to his chief. "I didn't mean
to run into this camp without being signalled. As
I was saying, I ain't one to promote trouble, but
there's a gentleman downstairs who's calling off
our race."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>"Mr. Rose is explaining to our driver that he
ain't fit to be allowed on a race course. And no
one's opposing his remarks any."</p>

<p>Gerard divined the situation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go down," Flavia begged, as he turned to her.
"I have been selfish to keep you here; I might
have known! But I saw Corrie just for a moment,
then father sent me to you. Go to Corrie; Mr.
Rupert will bring me."</p>

<p>"I can guess that I'm a fierce bad postman,"
Rupert dryly acknowledged. "But I ain't likely
to confuse ladies on the way downstairs. You're
sure needed below."</p>

<p>In the empty paved space before the hotel, the
Mercury Titan still reposed its massive bulk, with
its driver in his seat, his fair head uncovered in the
pink-and-gold light and his face turned to the
man who stood beside the car. There was neither
heat nor resentment in either Mr. Rose's expression
or his son's as the older man came over to
shake hands with Gerard. Corrie did not move;
his left arm was thrown about the neck of the huge
dog reared up beside him against the machine.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you looking so well," Mr. Rose
briefly greeted. "I have been talking to Corrie,
here, while we waited for you, Gerard, but this
thing won't do."</p>

<p>"What won't do, Mr. Rose?" Gerard questioned,
equally matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>"You know, and Corrie knows. I appreciate
the way you have stood by him and the way he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
has kept to his work&mdash;I'm proud of it&mdash;but this
isn't a question of how any of us three feel. I am
sorry to hurt him, but we have got to face facts.
A man who loses his temper is not fit for certain
places; a race track is one."</p>

<p>"The Corrie Rose whom I know and who
trained under me is fit for any place," Gerard
gravely maintained. The work of months was on
the verge of loss; he gauged very exactly what
this sentence would result in for Flavia's brother.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose glanced towards his son; if his powerful,
square-cut face was inflexible, it was without
hardness.</p>

<p>"Gerard, I am sorry," he repeated. "It's like
you to overlook what happened to yourself and
try him again; he and I have got more to consider
and to be responsible for. He might race straight
for years, yes, forever; but his temper might
slip him to-morrow. I know he means right, but
it can't be chanced. I'll risk seeing no more men
picked up as you were. Corrie, whenever I've
said must&mdash;that hasn't been often&mdash;you've answered.
I think you will now. Get off that
machine and come home with me, my boy; we will
try a fresh start, you and I."</p>

<p>Corrie stirred slightly; even his lips were gray
and dark circles appeared suddenly stamped be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>neath
his eyes. He offered no defence or demur,
but before his movement could spell obedience
Gerard had sprung across the intervening space
and dropped his left hand on the driver's arm,
forcing him to retain his seat.</p>

<p>"Stay there," he commanded curtly. "You
are my employee, under contract to drive my cars
this season; if you break your signed agreement
I will bring you up before the A.M.A. board
and have you suspended for unprofessional conduct."</p>

<p>Corrie gasped as from a dash of cold water in
the face, the rough tonic effectually bringing him
out of his daze of habitual submission.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rose, this is not sentiment, but business,"
Gerard continued in his usual tone. "Corrie is
not racing to-morrow for the first time, or for the
fifth or sixth, this season. He is the cordially
liked and respected comrade of his fellow-drivers&mdash;there
is not one who would not laugh in your
face at the idea of fearing to have him among
them. I tell you, for the rest, that any other
man on the course might let his nerves trick his
self-control; Corrie Rose never will. I know
him, now, better than you yet can. But," he
snatched a rapid survey of Corrie, then lifted his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
hand from the other's arm and drew back, "he
is not a child; let him decide."</p>

<p>"Corrie&mdash;&mdash;" his father recommenced, his
voice choked.</p>

<p>But Corrie had found himself. He laid one
firm, gauntleted hand on the beloved steering-wheel
and turned to Mr. Rose the serious countenance
and steadfast eyes of the new Corrie of the
Mercury's making. With the other hand he
pressed the dog's great head closer to him; perhaps
only Allan Gerard saw and translated the
pathos of that unconscious gesture.</p>

<p>"I would do anything else, sir," he stated
simply. "But Gerard has stayed by me through
the worst time I will ever have. I know&mdash;you
gave me money; but he helped me <i>live</i>. Afterward
I will do whatever you bid me, now I cannot
leave him without a driver on the eve of a race.
All the more," his speaking glance went to
Gerard, "all the more I must stay, because he
would rather hold me strictly to a business contract
than remind me that I owe him anything or
that it is through me that he is not driving this
car himself."</p>

<p>There was a moment of absolute silence. Then
the rustle of soft garments came with Flavia's
swift crossing from the doorway where she and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
Rupert had witnessed the contest. Straight to
the side of the gray machine she went, and clasping
her little hands over her brother's arm, raised
to him the high trust and unchanging love of
her regard.</p>

<p>"Dearest, I hope you win, to-morrow," she said
bravely and sweetly. "But kiss me, Corrie, and
come home afterward. We need you, papa and
I&mdash;and Allan."</p>

<p>"Other Fellow," he thanked her, under his
breath, and leaned down to give the caress.</p>

<p>Gerard and Mr. Rose were looking at each
other.</p>

<p>"You win," conceded the older man, without
rancor. "I hope we are not sorry. Bring him
to the house after you get through, to-morrow, I
guess we'll be a family party."</p>

<p>The snorting uproar of an arriving racing car
crashed across reply.</p>

<p>"Hey, Rosie, did you rope those hams and
eggs?" blithely shouted the masked driver, checking
his machine. "If you didn't, I'll hook a wheel
off your cart to-morrow when I pass you. Why
haven't you canned your car yet? Oh, excuse
<i>me</i>!" perceiving Flavia.</p>

<p>"I roped them, George," assured Corrie. "I'm
coming in, now."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert advanced to the front of the Mercury.</p>

<p>"You're giving orders," he signified to his
driver. "Do I crank?"</p>

<p>The slight episode was the fitting period to
Gerard's argument; he gave Mr. Rose his fine,
cool smile to point it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Frederick the Great did not go home to the
pink villa. Not even Flavia could win him from
the master he had refound. So it happened that
when Gerard went to Corrie, after midnight, he
discovered his driver seated beside an open window
in the drab, cheerless hotel bedroom, his arms
folded on the sill and the dog's head resting on
his knee.</p>

<p>"Corrie, do you know it is past twelve o'clock?"
he exclaimed, purposely authoritative in spite of
his aching pity. "I saw the light over your
door and came in to give you what Rupert describes
as a calling down. How do you expect
to be up fresh and fit for a race at dawn? You
go to bed, young man, where I sent you two good
hours ago."</p>

<p>"I am going," Corrie replied, without turning.
"I'm&mdash;all right. Gerard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The pause was so long that Gerard came quietly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
over and put his hand on the other's shoulder,
waiting.</p>

<p>"Gerard, do you remember what Rupert once
said, in the yacht club where we fed the tramp,
about my getting just what I earned and that no
luck would soften my brick walls? And I said
I was content because I meant to earn what I
wanted. I didn't know what I was talking about,
but he was right. I'm not complaining, you know;
it's fair enough. No, don't answer yet; that isn't
what I meant to say."</p>

<p>The dog moved restlessly and whined, nestling
closer to the master he loved. Corrie dropped a
hand to the animal's neck.</p>

<p>"This good old chap and I will go to bed,
presently. We've got to win, to-morrow; it's the
last time. Gerard, did you ever read a poem
Flavia and I used to like, I wonder? About a
man having the strength of ten, because his heart
was clean? Do you believe it&mdash;I mean, that a man
can stand more if he knows he is right inside
than if, if he could not think that?"</p>

<p>"Corrie, yes, I do believe it. But there are
few stainless Galahads. Strength and rightness
do not depend on the past, but the present. The
finest strength I have seen, has been in men who,
who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>The intended conclusion died on his lips, before
he found words to soften its intrinsically harsh
implication. Corrie had turned to him a glance so
clear, a face so startling in its white resolution
and dignity of fearless candor, that Gerard drew
back with a sensation of rebuked presumptuousness.
What he had offered as a consolation suddenly
loomed as an insult.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Corrie, quite simply.
"You're awfully good to me, Gerard. I don't
know why I said all that&mdash;I, I guess something
slipped. Good night; Fred and I will get some
sleep. It's a short night, anyhow."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>XVI</h2>
<h3>THE WHITE ROAD OF HONOR</h3>

<p>The ruddy dawn that flushed along the edge
of the east illuminated a vast, waiting multitude.
For its twelve miles of twisted length, the narrow
ribbon of the Cup course was walled in on either
side by the massed people and uncounted
hundreds of automobiles. The neighboring
States, the great cities of New York and Jersey,
the countrysides far and near had emptied their
motor-car enthusiasts and sport lovers into this
strip of Long Island, for to-day. Laughing, eating
picnic breakfasts, laying wagers and preparing
score-cards, the crowd swayed tiptoe on the
keen edge of expectancy; while up and down the
course drove and pushed the hurrying hundreds
who had not yet found satisfactory place.</p>

<p>As the dawn brightened into full, golden
October day, the crush became greater, the haste
and anticipation more intense. When a spluttering
roar announced one of the arriving racers,
the press would open, cheering, to leave his car
passage and close in behind him with boisterous
comment and criticism.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was the six Atlanta, Louis driving,
wasn't it, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Rub your eyes, you're asleep yet&mdash;that was
the Mercury, Rose up. Can't you tell a peach
from a lemon? Quit shoving, there!"</p>

<p>"Bet you ten a foreign car wins."</p>

<p>"Take you. It'll be the Bluette or the Mercury.
Get back, here comes another. They start in
twenty minutes."</p>

<p>Opposite the grand-stand the excitement was
greatest, but most orderly. Around the row of
repair pits men ran in and out, hovering about
their cars with solicitous final attentions and
eager encouragement to the smiling drivers. The
first machine was already at the starting-line,
ready as an arrow on the cord, its pilot smoking
a cigarette and chatting indolently with the official
starter.</p>

<p>"I drew second for you, last night," Gerard
reminded his driver, leaning against the Mercury
to look up at him. "Of course, you have your
numbers on. You will have to get into line in a
moment; don't you want to get out and move
about, first? You are going to have six or seven
hours' grind."</p>

<p>"I'm rested best right here," responded Corrie
placidly. He nestled himself more snugly into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
his seat and proceeded to fasten on the mask and
hood that quenched his blond youth into kinship
of blank identity with every other driver on the
course. "The crowd is pretty thick; I hope they
get the people off."</p>

<p>"The police are clearing the way, now.
Corrie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The thunderous voice of the car from the next
camp interrupted speech as it went past them.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Rosie! I'll leave your rear wheels
alone," shouted its driver. "By-by, Allan."</p>

<p>"If he's worried bad about his, I'll lend him a
safety-pin from my shirtwaist," drawled Rupert,
lounging up, hooking his own mask. "I ain't
muck-raking, but he broke his rear axle at Indianapolis,
last month, and lost two wheels."</p>

<p>"Corrie," Gerard pursued, "you are to bring
yourself back safely. I do not want any victories
at the price of your wreck. Remember that I am
responsible for your being at this work, and remember
Flavia."</p>

<p>"If I wreck my car there won't be <i>any</i> victory,"
Corrie practically returned. "Besides, I have
got Rupert with me to be looked after; if I were
making a speed dash by myself I might take a
chance or two. You never let me out alone. It's
all right. They are signalling."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert sprang into his seat like a rubber ball,
bracing one small legging-clad foot for support;
not the least of a racing mechanician's arts being
that of clinging at all times to his reeling post of
duty. Gerard held out his hand for Corrie's parting
clasp, then exchanged a warm grip with
Rupert. Between the driver and mechanician who
were to play the perilous game side by side, there
passed no such friendly touch. Gerard never
looked at the watching violet-blue eyes of the third
man during that farewell ceremony.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourselves," he bade.</p>

<p>"It's a nice morning for a ramble," observed
Rupert. "Don't worry, love, we'll be in to tea."</p>

<p>The Mercury Titan rolled into place in the
line of flaming, panting machines. The driver of
the first car threw away his cigarette and sat up.
There was a pause while the group of officials
poised, watches in hand, the people rose, then the
starter leaned forward and the first car sprang
from the line.</p>

<p>Amid the gay tumult of music and cheers, Corrie
waited the half-minute interval, his eyes on the
counting official, his hand on the lever, until the
starter's hearty clap fell on his shoulder with
the word:</p>

<p>"Go!"</p>

<p>With an explosive roar the Mercury shot across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the line and rushed, gathering speed in long leaps,
down the white course. Under the first arched
bridge, out of sight it flashed, followed by an
answering roar from the countless throats of those
between whose dense ranks it sped.</p>

<p>Gerard moved back a few paces. He had become
rather pale and grave; his gaze remained
fixed on the distant arch through which the Mercury
had vanished, nor did he turn to watch the
sending away of the other nineteen racers.</p>

<p>The touch laid on his sleeve was feather-light.</p>

<p>"I could not stay away," pleaded Flavia, beside
him. "May I watch Corrie with you, Allan?"</p>

<p>He wheeled eagerly, catching her retreating
hand before it escaped from his arm.</p>

<p>"I know why Corrie calls you 'Other Fellow,'"
he welcomed. "It is because you always know
the right thing to do."</p>

<p>They looked at each other in the morning
brightness, revelling in the fresh wonder of
mutual possession.</p>

<p>"This is hurting you," she grieved. "I saw
you before you did me, when the cars started&mdash;you
were thinking that last year you yourself
would have been there."</p>

<p>He checked her with the warm brilliance of his
smile.</p>

<p>"Not of myself," he denied. "If there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
anything to regret, do you think I could remember
it since I have you? No, I was thinking that
Corrie is barely twenty, that I had trained him
and sent him out there in that machine in defiance
of his father's wish&mdash;in fact, I believe I had an
attack of remorseful panic."</p>

<p>"You did it for Corrie," she gave swift comfort.
"Can you suppose that papa and I do not understand
that? You could have found drivers already
skilled, for your car; instead you troubled to
take him and make him what he is now. He is so
different from the desperate boy we left, Allan.
Whatever happens out there to-day, you have
done the best for Corrie."</p>

<p>The feverish activity of the camps was swirling
around them. Gerard gently drew the young girl
to the place where his private roadster waited,
somewhat aside from the centre of action, and
put her in the scarlet-cushioned seat. After her
paced Corrie's dog and took its place beside her
in stately guardianship.</p>

<p>"You can see everything here, and it is not so
rough for you," he explained. "Flavia, a year
ago I bought this, when I bought the yellow roses
on the night before my last drive. Will you let
me take off your little glove and put it on your
finger, now?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Her lashes sparkling wet, Flavia bent to him,
and in the face of crowds and camps Gerard set
his ring on her hand.</p>

<p>Men were leaning over railings, holding ready
watches open. At the repair pit next but one to
the Mercury's, the mechanics and men in charge
had drawn together in whispering groups.</p>

<p>"Car coming!" the word passed suddenly from
lip to lip.</p>

<p>On the summit of the white hill a mile distant,
a red signal flag went up. A dark shape darted
up over the rise, glanced with incredible swiftness
down the incline, disappearing momentarily behind
the packed angle, then again shot into view
and sped past the grand-stand like a humming
projectile; the driver a fixed statue of concentration
on the road before him, the mechanician half-turned
in his seat to watch for cars behind.</p>

<p>The place burst into uproar.</p>

<p>"Number two! Number two first!"</p>

<p>"Mercury leads!"</p>

<p>Horns were blown, handkerchiefs waved, the
applause breaking out anew as a second car
rushed past in hot pursuit of the flying Mercury.</p>

<p>"Three! Number three!"</p>

<p>"Oh you Bluette!"</p>

<p>"Here comes another&mdash;get back!"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Flavia stooped from her seat.</p>

<p>"Allan, that was Corrie&mdash;where is the car that
started before him?"</p>

<p>"Tire trouble, perhaps. You are trembling,
dear! Let my chauffeur take you home and wait
quietly there until I bring Corrie to you after
the race."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, please no. Here I can see him each lap
and know he is safe so far. Let me stay."</p>

<p>Two cars thundered past, struggling desperately
for place. The noise of the excited
people overwhelmed all conversation and left the
two lovers silent. From time to time a telephone
bell jingled across the tumult, blue-uniformed messengers
hurried here and there. But when the
last of twenty cars had passed, the twenty-first
not appearing, there fell a lull and men settled
back to wait for the second lap.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed, ten. The red flags went
up again; two speeding shapes topped the rise
and plunged out of sight.</p>

<p>"Two and three!"</p>

<p>"The Bluette&mdash;no&mdash;Mercury leads still!"</p>

<p>Excitement flared high as the two racers reappeared.
But as they swept down the straight
stretch, the mechanician of the Mercury raised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
his arms above his head in warning, the car slackened
speed and drew to the side of the course.
As the Bluette machine fled past him, Corrie
brought his car to a halt opposite the judges'
stand, leaning toward the official who sprang to
his side.</p>

<p>"The America's off the second bridge&mdash;send
the ambulance to the road below," he called, his
ringing voice penetrating bell-clear through the
heavier sounds.</p>

<p>Before his grim message was fairly comprehended,
he had slammed into a gear and was off
to regain the sacrificed moment.</p>

<p>There was a brief flurry in the official stand.
One man seized the telephone while another went
slowly to the lost car's camp. From lip to lip
the news went.</p>

<p>"Harry was married last week," observed an
oil-smeared mechanic, touching his cap to Gerard
in going by. "I guess there's no show after that
tumble; Rose might as well have saved his time."</p>

<p>"There is more than one prize in a contest,"
Gerard disagreed, meeting Flavia's awed eyes.
"Corrie Rose may win better than a gold cup."</p>

<p>"Corrie&mdash;&mdash;?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Corrie has given his leading place and one
of his hoarded fragments of time&mdash;these races are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
won or lost by scant minutes&mdash;for the bare chance
that his report might send aid to the injured men
a little sooner than if that task were left to the
frightened witnesses of the disaster."</p>

<p>Flavia's small head lifted proudly, bright color
flashed into the countenance whose loving faith
had never failed Corrie in his hours of disgrace.</p>

<p>"I wish papa had seen," she longed wistfully.
And after a moment: "You yourself have done
the same; he told me so, once. Now you have
taught him to do what you never can do any more,
poor Allan."</p>

<p>A curious expression crossed Gerard's mobile
face; hesitation and doubt blended with a luminous
radiance shining from some inward thought that
leaped up like a clear flame. He moved as if to
speak impulsively, but Flavia had turned to watch
the approach of a rushing car, and he remained
silent.</p>

<p>In the next hour, the Mercury passed the grand-stand
five times; sometimes alone, sometimes the
quarry of a coursing group of speed-hounds whose
flaming breath was close behind, sometimes itself
curving around some slower rival amid the wave-like
succession of cheers. The bulletin-board
showed Corrie running in third place when he
passed for the sixth time, with Rupert stretched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
along the edge of the car to relieve his cramped
limbs in an ease that suggested imminent death by
falling.</p>

<p>The seventh time the Mercury did not come
around. Gerard, who had been in front, returned
to Flavia with his steadying reassurance.</p>

<p>"Tire trouble, no doubt," he told her. "He
is due to have some; his luck has been astonishing
in escaping it so far. He is driving to win;
no car ever held the lead from start to finish."</p>

<p>Flavia folded her hands in her lap, not trusting
herself far enough to reply. Gerard studied his
watch in silent calculation, as the minutes ticked
past.</p>

<p>"It must have been two tires," he at last
hazarded. "When one blows out while actually
on a turn, the other is almost certain to follow.
Of course, they might have engine trouble."</p>

<p>A French car rolled up to its repair pit,
stopped, and suddenly burst into flames. There
was a wild scramble among its force of attendants,
a rush with fire extinguishers and pails of sand.
Before the danger was realized, it had ended and
the mechanics were at work upon the choked pipe
which had sent the car to its camp.</p>

<p>"Oh!" gasped the young girl, rising.</p>

<p>Gerard stopped her, pointing to the white hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
The roar of an approaching car filled the air;
as Flavia looked, the Mercury shot past, running
faultlessly, but carrying two spare tires where she
had started with four.</p>

<p>"They will be in, next lap," Gerard predicted.
"Rupert won't want to run with only two extra
tires on board, and I don't think Corrie will overrule
him."</p>

<p>He went forward to give some directions to
prepare for the flying visit, Flavia watching. She
made no demand for attention, no betrayal of
feminine timidity to hamper this man's world into
which she had been brought. Men looked curiously
at the delicate, serious girl who sat so quietly
in the Mercury camp, but gradually the information
crept out that she was Rose's sister and
Gerard's fianc&eacute;e, so that wonder became merely
admiration.</p>

<p>True to expectation, the Mercury halted before
her repair pit, on the next circuit.</p>

<p>"Cases," commanded Rupert, tersely, out of
his seat before the stop. "Move quick! Who's
nailed fast now?"</p>

<p>The slur was undeserved; the waiting tires were
flung on and secured by hurrying hands.</p>

<p>"Drink it," Gerard ordered, thrusting a cup
at Corrie, as that young driver leaned wearily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
back. "I don't care whether you want it or
not."</p>

<p>"It's the people," Corrie explained, his blue
eyes seeking Gerard's across the goggles. "I
don't mind anything else. They're over the course
so you can't see ahead. Jim hit a woman, on the
back stretch, as we passed."</p>

<p>He put the heavy china cup to his lips, but
dropped it with a crash to seize his levers as
Rupert bounded in beside him.</p>

<p>"Have the people cleared off," he petitioned
over his shoulder, while sending his car forward.</p>

<p>Gerard went to the judges' stand.</p>

<p>Corrie Rose was not the first or only driver to
complain of the packed course. The Mercury had
scarcely departed when the Marathon car came
in, its experienced and steel-fibred pilot on the
brink of nervous breakdown.</p>

<p>"I won't drive if the mob isn't put off the
road," he defied his manager. "I've killed a
woman back there&mdash;do you hear? A <i>woman</i>!
There are women and kids right against the
wheels on the worst turns. Get 'em off!"</p>

<p>The Marathon force flocked around him in consternation,
while his manager ran to the judges
and the owner of the car implored and adjured
the recalcitrant driver to go on without further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
loss of time. But it was Gerard who saved the
situation for his rival.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Jim," he called across, issuing
from the official stand and comprehending the
deadlock at sight. "You only broke her leg&mdash;a
telephone report came. Go on; everyone's with
you, man!"</p>

<p>The Marathon's mechanician, wise in knowledge
of his pilot, at this juncture leaned over and thrust
between Jim's lips a lighted cigar.</p>

<p>"Buck up! We're losin'," he urged roughly.</p>

<p>The driver's teeth sullenly clamped shut upon
the strong tobacco; he slammed viciously into a
gear and hurled his machine down the course
before the startled camp realized its victory. The
stop had lasted exactly three minutes, but it cost
the Marathon its hope of the race.</p>

<p>The morning advanced, gaining in sun-gilt
beauty. In the next hour four racers were taken
from the contest, three by mechanical difficulties,
one as the result of an accident that sent both
driver and mechanician to the hospital. The
Mercury continued to run steadily and evenly,
keeping a consistent pace.</p>

<p>"How much longer?" Flavia anxiously questioned,
once. "Do you think everything can stay
right to the very end, Allan?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerard laid his warm left hand over her cold
one, as it rested on the cushions, his loving eyes
caressing her.</p>

<p>"Two hours more, my Flavia. Most surely I
believe everything can stay right; why not? Remember
Corrie delights in this. He is happier now
than when he is what we call at rest. If," again
that singular expression of blended shadow and
inward illumination rose over his face, "if I were
to be made myself and wholly cured, it would not
change Corrie's position in Corrie's eyes. I cannot
help him there in that hard part, but I have
given him a way to forget for a while."</p>

<p>Her soft mouth bent grievedly; Flavia's attention
was effectually distracted from contemplation
of her brother's bodily peril.</p>

<p>Gerard turned aside. He had heard the reports
arrive of one accident after another, he saw driver
after driver come in gray-lipped and savage under
the strain of racing on the crowded path, and he
knew what Flavia did not&mdash;that this was proving
the most disastrous affair ever held on the Cup
course.</p>

<p>"I don't mind risking my own neck, I'm used
to that," gritted an old-time comrade to Gerard,
during a pause for refilling tanks. "It's the
people under foot; &mdash;&mdash; them! Haven't they any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
sense? Jim's Marathon hit a man, ten minutes
ago; he's still driving, half crazy, because he
can't stop. <i>Damn</i> the country police!"</p>

<p>"Rose&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Rose is changing tires at the Westbury turn.
I'm off."</p>

<p>That bit of news spared a bad quarter-hour to
the two who loved Corrie.</p>

<p>Gerard was at the front of the camp, watching
for his car, when he felt a hand lain on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Some racer just went off the turnpike into
the ditch," Mr. Rose's subdued tones informed
him. "Where's Corrie?"</p>

<p>"Safe; changing tires on this side of the turnpike,"
Gerard gave quick assurance. "It's not
he. But this has been a bad day; I'm not surprised
that you couldn't keep away from here."</p>

<p>"I couldn't keep away," Mr. Rose assented
heavily. He drew out his handkerchief and passed
it across his forehead, damp under the line of
reddish-gray hair, pushing open his overcoat with
the abrupt gesture that was also a habit of his
son's. "I've had a hell of an hour where I was,
Gerard. This morning I got a letter from my
niece, Isabel. It seems she is married and her
husband made her write it."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men looked fully at each other; some
quality in Thomas Rose's expression communicated
its white reflection to Gerard's changing face.</p>

<p>"He never did it&mdash;Corrie, I mean. Gerard,
Isabel Rose threw the wrench that struck you and
wrecked your car, last year. He's been shielding
her. God, how I've ground it into the boy!"</p>

<p>There was a tall pile of spare tires beside them;
on it Gerard put his hand, steadying himself
against the shock that was less of surprise than
of poignant self-reproach for his own failure to
divine this open riddle. In that moment of final
understanding, he knew that he had seen the pitiful
truth rise to the surface of Corrie's blue eyes a
hundred times, and had left its appeal to die out,
unanswered.</p>

<p>Far down the course a ripple of cheering started,
running nearer in a wave of gathering volume.
Out around the curve swooped a gray streak, fled
toward the camps, was opposite, and past. The
Mercury was unleashed and hunting down its lost
lead in the fastest speed of the day.</p>

<p>Mr. Rose brought his eyes from following its
flight to meet Gerard's gaze.</p>

<p>"You remember how Isabel nagged him to take
her around the race course in his pink machine,"
he reminded. "I forbade it and thought no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
about the thing. Well, she got him alone&mdash;you
know, I guess, that he was wild with boy's near-love
for her and would have let her drag the
heart out of his body&mdash;and she got his promise to
take her around once. She worked the plan all
out; Corrie started without his mechanician, and
she waited for him a mile down the course, dressed
in her riding-habit and wearing a man's cap and
motor-mask. She figured that no one would notice
her much on the road and Corrie could drop her
off after making the circuit, just before he reached
the camps, so that he would come in alone as he
started and no one would be the wiser. They were
just a couple of fool kids on a kid lark."</p>

<p>A yellow car roared to a stop beside them,
interrupting clamorously. From his seat its
mechanician fell rather than stepped.</p>

<p>"He smashed his wrist cranking her," the
driver raged. "Someone else&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>A blue-clad factory mechanic flung himself into
the vacant place, bare-headed, without coat or
mask.</p>

<p>"Here's my chance!" he exulted. "Go on,
I'm it."</p>

<p>The car leaped out, no second wasted in parley.
Men gathered up the injured mechanician and
hurried him away. Mr. Rose looked on as if at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
a stage scene which did not interest him, and dully
resumed his narrative.</p>

<p>"It worked all right, Gerard, until they met
you on the back stretch and you challenged Corrie
to race. He didn't want to, with her along,
but she devilled him to go on, and he did. I can
guess it went to his head, having her beside him.
When you began cutting Corrie off so he couldn't
pass by, he caught the joke right enough. She
says he was laughing when he began to pitch odd
screws and bolts at your car&mdash;he was never angry
for a moment, just playing, as you were. But
she was all excited over losing; when she saw he
had both hands busy and you were forcing them
back again, she snatched something out of the open
box Corrie had got the bolts from and threw it
at you, herself. She didn't know what she had
thrown or done, until she saw you fall stunned
across your steering-wheel and your car plunge
off the road."</p>

<p>"I might have known," said Gerard, and turned
his face to the course he did not see.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> might have known!" flared Mr. Rose.
"What was the matter with <i>me</i>? Hadn't I lived
with Corwin B. Rose since he was born and never
had seen him cheat or play foul, win or lose?
He was straight, always. I should have known<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
when he wouldn't talk&mdash;he never was afraid to
speak out and take his licking. Oh yes, I belong
to the brutal common people and Corrie wasn't
brought up by moral suasion; he had more
than one flogging before he was fourteen and we
called him a man. And he never lied to dodge one.
I went back on him; he never did on me."</p>

<p>The gay tumult of the tensely-strung multitude
was in their ears, the band-music crashed blatant
aid to the excitement. With a humming purr and
rush the Mercury car shot past again, followed by
the long roll of applause.</p>

<p>"We're leading by a minute and a half," one of
Gerard's men triumphed, running past on some
errand. "Oh you Rosie!"</p>

<p>"He stopped his machine as soon as he could,
and put Isabel out," Mr. Rose continued sombrely.
"She says herself that she was scared sick and
begged him to save her. I can guess that part.
Anyhow, he told her to go home and say nothing,
that he would take care of her. He did. If it
hadn't been for your protecting him, that morning,
he might have ended in State's prison. I
don't suppose she would ever have cleared him if
she hadn't fallen in love with one of those Southerners
she has been visiting, and blurted out the
truth when he proposed, the other day. He put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
her in a buggy, drove over to the nearest clergyman,
and married her then and there; then gave
her paper and pen and made her write the whole
story to me. He is a gentleman; he'd stand with
her for whatever she had done, but he would not
stand for her leaving Corrie to bear her blame.
I'll make it up to him, yet!"</p>

<p>"Does Flavia know?" Gerard asked.</p>

<p>"I gave her Isabel's letter on the way across
to you."</p>

<p>Flavia was sitting in the car with her wet handkerchief
clasped in her folded hands, her veils
drawn across the hushed beauty of her face. As
Gerard came up, she bent to him.</p>

<p>"Corrie," she breathed. "Corrie, to do this!
I am proud and glad and humbled. How could
he, how could he?"</p>

<p>"He has more courage than I," Gerard gravely
acknowledged. "I could not have done it. A
superb folly, unjust to himself and us. He might
safely have confided in his father or me and have
trusted Isabel to our care."</p>

<p>"Allan, she had his promise to tell no one and
she held him to it. She was ill and hysterical with
terrified shame; Isabel never could endure to be
found at fault even in little things. She was not
bad or wicked, but just a coward."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>"She found strength enough to watch Corrie
under torture week after week," he retorted, his
golden-brown eyes hardening to agate. "If I had
been killed under my car, Flavia, do you realize
that Rupert would have brought your brother
face to face with the electric chair? And Corrie
would have shut his lips and endured it all. Don't
ask me to pity Isabel Rose&mdash;I've lived this year
with her victim."</p>

<p>Trembling under the control forced on herself,
Flavia slipped her hand into his.</p>

<p>"I know, Allan, I know. Yet she did suffer to
see his suffering. In her letter, she says that
Corrie came to her at dawn, the last morning
we were all at home, and called her out into the
empty hall to beseech her for permission to tell
you. He had not been to bed that night, at all.
She never afterward forgot his desperate, worn
face and that memory finally drove her to confession.
But she refused him. He did break
down then, and flashed out at her that he must
and would tell you the truth, when he left her.
Of course he did not do so. Allan, she declares
that he then told you, that she knows it because
you wrote to her that evening about your accident
and said you would take care of Corrie whatever
happened."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"I!"</p>

<p>"Your letter to me. She had been insane with
dread all day, believing Corrie would fulfil his
threat to tell you his innocence, and when Rupert
came she saw only that idea confirmed. She knew
of no relations between you and me. She thought
only of herself."</p>

<p>Gerard looked at her, having no words; presently
he sat down on the edge of the car at her
feet, and they continued silent, hand in hand.
Mr. Rose had found a camp-chair in the shadow
of a wall, and sat watching the race in grim
quiescence.</p>

<p>When the last hour of the contest was reached,
it was noted that the Mercury car had suddenly
slackened its pace. The difference in speed was
not great; the car was running faultlessly, but
keeping a slower gait. The men in the Mercury
camp clustered together, waiting and discussing.</p>

<p>The car came around on the next lap with the
condition hardly improved. Rupert was neither
watching behind nor busied with his usual duties,
but sat erect in his seat with one arm around
Corrie's shoulders, apparently talking in the
driver's ear, head bent to head. Neither glanced
toward the row of repair pits or the grand-stand,
as they passed between and on out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
view. Gerard's brows contracted sharply; he
uttered an excuse to Flavia and went front.</p>

<p>"Morton's giving out, too," the manager of
the next camp imparted confidentially, joining him.
"The road-bed is rotten, the men say. Ten feet
of it caved in at one turn. Too bad!"</p>

<p>"Rose had no sleep last night," Gerard briefly
excused his driver.</p>

<p>"God, how I've ground it into the boy," Corrie's
father had said; and Gerard could have echoed
the cry, looking back at what he had meant for
kindness.</p>

<p>The moments dragged, the next scant quarter-hour
stretched long. But at last the Mercury's
vibrant voice rolled down the white road, approaching.
Up to her camp the car sped, and stopped.</p>

<p>Before the halt was effected, Rupert had
snatched off the driver's suffocating mask, leaning
over him.</p>

<p>"Oil, gas," he demanded generally. "Jump
for those tanks, <i>quick</i>. Here, Rose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His white, fatigue-drawn face bared to the fresh
wind, Corrie tried to speak, but instead let his
head fall forward on his arm as it rested upon the
steering-wheel.</p>

<p>"Rose, you low-down quitter, you punk chauffeuse!"
Rupert stormed at him. "You going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to chuck up a won race? You mollycoddle&mdash;&mdash;Water,
you fellows&mdash;can't you even wait on a
real man? Here, Rose, you ain't anything but a
fake!"</p>

<p>He carefully splashed the water over the boyish
forehead, streaks of grime trickling over them
both.</p>

<p>"Fill the tanks," Corrie gasped, lying passive
under the rough treatment. "I'm ready to go
on&mdash;tell me when."</p>

<p>Gerard was beside the car.</p>

<p>"Corrie," he began.</p>

<p>Rupert unexpectedly flamed out at him across
the prostrate figure:</p>

<p>"Let him alone! He ain't a Sandow and the
driving's hell. He's going on, I tell you. Here,
Rose, get some class into you, what?"</p>

<p>But Gerard had a better tonic than cold water
or stinging abuse. He silenced the mechanician
with a glance and laid his hand on Corrie's arm.</p>

<p>"Corrie, your cousin has told us the truth," he
said. "We know, now, who caused the wreck of
my car last year."</p>

<p>Corrie started so violently as to overturn the
jug in Rupert's hand and send its contents over
them both, his avid blue eyes flashed wide to
Gerard.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isabel&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Isabel has told us that your companion threw
the wrench that struck me, and why you bore the
charge. You stand cleared."</p>

<p>Corrie slowly drew himself erect in his seat,
brushing the water from his eyes and pushing
back his wet clusters of fair hair. It was not so
much color as vital life that flowed into his face,
mechanically he reached for his mask.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he answered. "I can drive, now."</p>

<p>"Tanks full," shouted a score of voices.</p>

<p>Men scattered from around the car's wheels in
expectation of the start, Gerard stepped back.
But Corrie turned in his seat and held out his
hand to the speechless Rupert.</p>

<p>"You heard&mdash;now do it," he required.</p>

<p>Still dumb, the mechanician dragged off his
glove and gave for the race's finish the hand-clasp
that he had denied for its start.</p>

<p>The Mercury sprang from her camp with a
roar of unloosed power and speed-lust. Car and
driver splendid mates, they fled in pulsating vigor
down their white path where the sun was shining.</p>

<p>During the rest of the hour, people stood up
in seats and automobiles, watching the Mercury
Titan. Not before had they witnessed driving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
like that, never again could the driver himself
equal that inspired flight.</p>

<p>Just sixty-nine seconds ahead of his nearest
rival, Corrie Rose brought his car across the line.
As he halted the Mercury before the judges, the
people burst out over the course and overwhelmed
the victors. Music, clicking cameras, cheers and
congratulations&mdash;the current of gayety swirled
around the winning racer. The first to grasp
Corrie's hand was the official starter who had sent
him out six hours before, the second was the driver
of the barely-defeated Marathon. After that,
there was no record possible.</p>

<p>It was some time before Corrie and Rupert
could be rescued from the enthusiastic press of
admirers. When at last the Mercury came over
to its own camp, Gerard was first able to bring
Flavia to her brother.</p>

<p>Stiff, weary and dishevelled, Corrie descended
from his car, tripping impatiently over the
flowers someone had placed in it. There was a
perfunctory quality in the tenderness with which
he kissed Flavia, as there had been a restive haste
in his acceptance of his present ovation. Now, he
turned his candid eyes full to Gerard's, baring his
inmost need to the one who always understood.</p>

<p>"I want my father," said Corrie Rose.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>Very lovingly Gerard put his arm around the
slim shoulders and drew his master-driver to a
tent behind the repair pit, there left him to enter
alone and went back to Flavia.</p>

<p>"I put twelve ham sandwiches and my will in
the locker, there," he found Rupert sweetly explaining
to the young girl. "I guessed I'd have
use for one or the other by this time. And I
guess I guessed right. Oh, no&mdash;I'll be able to
take my regular nourishment just the same, when
we get back; this won't count. I," he sent Gerard
a glance of saturnine intelligence, "I've got myself
all tired out here lately trying to keep on
disliking Rose."</p>

<p>"Allan, have you thought that we are going
home?" Flavia asked, lifting her happy face to
her lover, as he stood over her. "<i>Home</i>; papa
and Corrie, and you and I, who were so far
apart."</p>

<p>"I have thought that you would put on that
lace frock you wore the last evening I saw you
there, only this time you will come where I can
touch you. Shall I tell you what you looked like
that night? You were a golden rose in a sheath
of snow, quite out of reach. And you played your
dainty music so calmly and smoothly, while I was
on fire and seeing rose-color as I listened to your
father's stories. I was like poor Cyrano de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Bergerac: I had gazed so long at your sun-bright
little head that when I looked away my dazzled
eyes still saw gold."</p>

<p>Her red mouth dimpled into soft mischief and
daring.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you what <i>I</i> saw while I was playing,
Allan? I watched you under my eyelashes&mdash;this way&mdash;and
I wondered whether anyone else
ever looked quite so nice even from behind, and,
and what it would be like to touch your crinkly
hair with one's finger."</p>

<p>"Do it now!"</p>

<p>She declined with an eloquent gesture. Around
their enclosure the vast crowds were streaming
back to New York, the course was filled from edge
to edge with a solid procession of homing automobiles
of every type and age. Amid noise and congestion
and merriment, Long Island's guests were
trouping out.</p>

<p>But comparative quietness had descended upon
the row of pits when, half an hour later, Mr. Rose
and Corrie strolled casually up to join the other
two members of the party.</p>

<p>"I don't know how long you propose to stay
here," observed the senior, tolerantly. "Lenoir
is waiting with the limousine, and it strikes us
it's about time to start for home."</p>

<p>"Chilly wind blowing, too," Corrie suggested,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
his hands in the pockets of his long gray motor-coat.
"Fancy Lenoir lugging this old coat of
mine around in the car, Other Fellow, until now.
It's a wonder the butterflies haven't eaten it&mdash;moths,
I mean."</p>

<p>Gerard and Flavia exchanged a glance of infinitely
tender comprehension of these two.</p>

<p>"I want to show you all something, first,"
Gerard detained them. "We don't want to take
any worries home that we can leave here. Give
me that ball of tape you put in your pocket this
morning, Corrie."</p>

<p>Astonished, Corrie obeyed.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rupert!" Gerard sent his clear voice
across to where that black-eyed mechanician leaned
against the Mercury Titan, a hundred feet away.
"Catch!"</p>

<p>Rupert promptly turned. The improvised ball
in his fingers, Gerard slowly raised both arms
above his head in the old graceful gesture, his
brilliant amber eyes smiling at his companions,
then launched the sphere straight to its goal.</p>

<p>It was not Flavia who found overtaxed nerves
give way.</p>

<p>"Gerard! <i>Gerard!</i>" Corrie's cry rang out; he
sank down on a camp-chair and covered his face.</p>

<p>Alarmed and remorseful, Gerard sprang to him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>"Corrie&mdash;don't take it like that! It is all
right; I've been fighting for this ten months
under a French surgeon's orders."</p>

<p>"You never told me. Oh, Gerard, Gerard!"</p>

<p>"I did not want to tell you until I was sure
the cure was real and permanent. And I was not
sure until I met the surgeon in New York, yesterday."</p>

<p>"You could have told me last night. I might
have been killed to-day and <i>never</i> have known."</p>

<p>Gerard exchanged with Mr. Rose a glance of
very sad understanding, a mutual acknowledgment
of mutual error.</p>

<p>"Would you have driven the Mercury to-day
against your father's wish, if you had known that
I should be able to drive my own car next year?
I think not. If you were to be taken from me and
this life, I wanted you to take with you the
memory of this race instead of the humiliation of
a withdrawal. And I believed that I was dealing
with an unsteadied boy who needed the sharp tonic
of work and danger&mdash;ah, Corrie, forgive me!&mdash;instead
of the strongest man in endurance I ever
knew. But I would tell no one else until I did
you, although," he turned to the radiant girl,
"although it was hard not to hold out both hands
to Flavia."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>She put her hands in both his, then, and felt
them close on hers for all time.</p>

<p>"Rupert knew," Corrie presently divined, as
the unsurprised mechanician lounged toward them.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rupert knew," Gerard confirmed. "He
helped me go through the treatment each day.
One reason I did not tell you what we were doing,
was that the process was not very pleasant, and it
used to leave me rather upset and sick for a while&mdash;you
caught me too soon after it that morning
you signed the contracts. Don't wince; <i>you</i> had
nothing to do with my smash."</p>

<p>"But I blamed myself, always!" Corrie stood
up, thrusting his hands into his pockets and
squaring his shoulders with the sturdy responsibility
so easily read now. "I had no business
to take Isabel there, and I put the mischief into
her head by pitching bolts at you. She couldn't
tell it was in fun. I&mdash;I would rather have known
you'd get well, Gerard, than have known I was
cleared."</p>

<p>"Didn't it ever occur to you, Corrie, to blame
<i>us</i>, when we were so ready to convict you and
pass judgment?" countered Gerard.</p>

<p>Checked, Corrie surveyed the three with the
ingenuous astonishment of a new point of view.</p>

<p>"Blame you people?" he marvelled. "Why,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
when I thought what a low brute you had every
right to believe I was, I used to feel like thanking
you for staying in the same room with me. I&mdash;Well,
I guess it's time to go home, isn't it? I'll
leave you to start."</p>

<p>"Leave us?" exclaimed Flavia.</p>

<p>"You'll make a line for that limousine right
now, Corwin B.," pronounced Mr. Rose, with the
familiar easy mastery that was a caress.</p>

<p>His son laughingly shook his fair head.</p>

<p>"No, thanks, sir. I'm going to drive the
Mercury Titan home and put it in the garage.
Unless," he looked over his shoulder, "unless
Rupert is afraid to trust himself to ride with a
punk chauffeuse and a no-class fake?"</p>

<p>"I ain't real nervous to-day," drawled the
mechanician graciously. "Nor I ain't supposing
but what you're entitled to a chauffeur's license,
Rose."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>XVII</h2>
<h3>THE END OF THE ROAD</h3>

<p>In the golden afternoon sunlight, when tree-shadows
stretched long and velvet-soft across the
lawns and terraces of Mr. Rose's park, amid all
October's blending fragrances and mellow tints,
Corrie Rose came home. After all, it was Jack
Rupert who put the Mercury Titan in the garage,
opposite the house Corrie; yielding his seat to
his mechanician.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll let you take her around; I
want to go in with my people," the driver explained.
"You might as well get established
here, you know, since you are going to stay some
time. I," it was so long since anyone had seen
that teasing mischief sparkling in Corrie's unclouded
eyes, "I have grown so used to your
gentle, winning ways that I don't know how to
get along without you, Rupert."</p>

<p>Rupert settled himself in the great machine, regarding
his companion with dry intelligence.</p>

<p>"I've got more respect for your morals than I
had, Rose, and less for your sense," he issued

before sending the car away.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right again," Corrie agreed. He turned and
looked up at the house.</p>

<p>The three from the limousine were waiting for
him upon the columned veranda. Weary, stiff
and aching from long exertion, soiled with the
dust of course and road, Corrie, victor of that
day and of many days, climbed the broad rose-colored
steps to them. There was nothing adequate
to say, had they been a demonstrative family;
as it was, no one considered speech. But at the
open door Corrie stopped, turning his bright, clear
glance to his father. And Thomas Rose closed
his hand on his son's shoulder, so that they crossed
the threshold together.</p>

<p>Gerard detained Flavia a pace behind.</p>

<p>"When I see you in the lace gown, I am going
to kiss you," he stated firmly. "I do not care
how many people are present or where it is. So
you had better come down early to the fountain
arcade, where I have pictured you more often than
you will ever know. Will you, flower-lady?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she doubted. "If I think of it."</p>

<p>"Heartsease for thought," said Gerard, and
kissed her dimpling mouth.</p>

<p>On the stairs a few minutes later, Corrie overtook
his sister and caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>"I need a bath and some fresh rags and&mdash;well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
everything," he laughed. "I'm not fit to touch&mdash;do
you mind?"</p>

<p>She clasped her arms around his neck, nestling
her soft cheek against the rough, grimy cloth of
his driving-suit.</p>

<p>"I love you! Oh, my dear, my dear, if mamma
had lived, this year could never have happened!
Not to you, nor to me."</p>

<p>He looked into her upturned face, realizing
with her the difference that might have been
wrought by a mother's clairvoyant tenderness and
the link of a wife's understanding between her
husband and her children. No, without this lack
in the household the year's deception could not
have endured. If the chain of Roses had not
once been broken, it could not have come so near
this later destruction.</p>

<p>"Flavia, you know I feel how good they have
all been to me? You know what nonsense it was
for Allan&mdash;he tells me I can't call my own brother
'Gerard'&mdash;what nonsense it was for him to suggest
that I ever could blame anyone but myself
for what I had to stand?"</p>

<p>"I know you feel it so, Corrie."</p>

<p>"Then, I want to say there was only you, Other
Fellow, who <i>never</i> hurt or made it harder."</p>

<p>"Even&mdash;Allan?"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think there never was a man so generous
as Allan&mdash;but, only you. I," he drew a breath of
inexpressible content, "I see a bully good life
ahead, but I don't see any woman in it, unless I
find one like you. And from what I overheard
Allan saying, just now when I passed you both
at the alcove, he's secured the only perfect angel-girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laughing, warmly flushed, she put her hand
across his lips.</p>

<p>But it was that evening, in the glowing richness
and repose of the dining-room in the pink marble
villa, now reinvested with the dignity of a home,
that the core of the late situation was touched.</p>

<p>Once more Allan Gerard was intent upon the
study of Flavia's young beauty as she sat near him
in the lace gown, this time with his ring flaunting
conquest on her fragile hand. Mr. Rose was leaning
back and idly watching the ice dissolve in his
glass, when Corrie broke the pause, resting his
arms on the table and lifting his gay, mirthful
face to the man behind his chair:</p>

<p>"Take away those oysters, Perkins! I want my
soup right off, and a lot of it. I'm about
starved&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped, himself struck by the
words.</p>

<p>The evoked recollections of that last dinner to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>gether
were too much. Mr. Rose carefully put the
glass down, his strong jaw setting. Flavia's large
startled eyes flashed wet as they went to her
brother.</p>

<p>"Corrie, Corrie, I can understand how you
began," escaped Gerard impulsively. "But how
could you carry it on month after month?"</p>

<p>The ruddy color ran up to Corrie's forehead,
he looked down at the table, sobered.</p>

<p>"It didn't take me long to see I made an awful
bungle of things," he confessed, half-shy and
hesitant. "And it got worse and worse as I saw
what I had done to you people. Yet I'd given
my word. I guess you'll understand a lot more
than I can say; as Allan will understand, now,
why I couldn't help knocking down that tramp who
wanted money because I belonged in prison and
wasn't there. It was all too much for me to
think out! But&mdash;isn't there something said about
a fellow who puts his hand to the plough not
taking it off? I used to say that over to myself,
when&mdash;well, at night, for instance. I might have
been a chump, but it seemed up to me to keep on
with the work I had started, and&mdash;and not to
flinch."</p>

<p>"Dear, if you had only spared yourself what
you could," Flavia grieved. "You could have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
said it was an accident, at least; that you never
meant to hurt Allan."</p>

<p>Corrie's violet-blue eyes laughed out of their
eclipse and sought his father.</p>

<p>"Not much, Other Fellow! No tricks for mine;
I had to tell just the truth or shut up. No, sir,
whatever he <i>looked</i> like, Corrie Rose had to plough
a straight furrow."</p>

<p>"Straight furrows lead home," said Allan
Gerard, not sententiously, but musingly.</p>

<p>He also looked toward Mr. Rose, and the senior
nodded slow agreement.</p>

<p>"They do, Gerard. And we get more, sometimes,
than we've any right to expect from anything
we give. Where we spent this summer,
Flavia and I liked the people. What we did for
them didn't cost us much; we were not looking
for any returns. But the news of it got out, somehow,
and was cabled to New York days before
we arrived here. One of the journals got the
story and worked up a Sunday article about what
an American millionaire had done for Val de Rosas,
and interviewed a certain Luis C&aacute;rdenas and his
wife, Elvira, whom Flavia had brought together&mdash;it
seems they are happy and prospering well, my
girl&mdash;and printed the whole thing along with a
photograph of Corrie in his racing clothes, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
my son. New York papers go everywhere. The
Southerner whom Isabel was in love with brought
that article about her family to her, as an excuse
for an early call, the morning he asked her to
marry him. She says, herself, it was the picture
of Corrie in the motor dress she last had seen him
wear on the day of the accident, that broke her
up so, and when her lover proposed she told him
the whole truth. If I hadn't paid the taxes for
Val de Rosas, Corrie would have been bearing a
false charge yet."</p>

<p>The silence held many thoughts; a silence broken
by Corrie himself.</p>

<p>"To-morrow we'll write a jolly note to Isabel,"
he affirmed contentedly. "She doesn't need to
worry on her honeymoon, poor kid; she has
squared up. There doesn't seem to be any need
for anyone to worry, ever, while they're trying to
keep straight, since the scheme is a Square Deal,
you know."</p>

<p>The two older men exchanged a glance.</p>

<p>"I guess some of us need more than a square
deal, Corwin B.," his father pronounced. "But
it's all right; we get that, too."</p>

<p>Like her most successful stories, "Marcia Schuyler" and
"Phoebe Deane," Mrs. Lutz's new novel is set in New York State
about 1826&mdash;quaint old days of poke bonnets and full skirts.</p>

<p>It is a refreshingly sweet and charming story and the author
has created in Dawn, a gentle appealing heroine, whose tangled
romance only serves to make more happy the beautiful ending when
all the threads of Dawn's life are straightened out.</p>

<p>Few present-day books are so thoroughly wholesome, fresh and
charming as this quiet, old-fashioned romance, as refreshingly
sweet as the name of its heroine.</p>

<p>Phoebe Deane, a motherless girl, meets the trials of a life of
dependence, and an unwelcome suitor, with a brave, sweet spirit.
In spite of deceit and treachery, her lover at last comes to her
rescue, and her happiness is assured.</p>

<p>The story opens upon the wedding preparations for the marriage
of winsome, wilful Kate to strong and good David. Complications
arise by which David marries her younger sister Marcia
instead and it is only after a period of trials and heartaches that
Marcia wins her husband's love when he comes to understand her
worthiness and Kate's heartless frivolity and duplicity. The <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> pronounces Marcia "One of the most lovable heroines that
ever lived her life in the pages of a romance."</p>

Wells' pen that one wonders if she possesses a dual personality
or is it merely extraordinary versatility, for she
can certainly write detective stories just as well as she can write
nonsense verse. The story is told in the first person by a modest
young sleuth who is sent to a suburban place to ferret out
the mystery which shrouds the murder of a prominent man.
Circumstantial evidence in the shape of a gold mesh bag points
to a woman as the criminal, and the only possible one is the dead
man's niece with whom the detective promptly falls in love,
though she is already engaged to her uncle's secretary, an
alliance which the dead man insisted must be discontinued, otherwise
he would disinherit the girl. The story is well told and the
interest is cleverly aroused and sustained.</p>

The finger of suspicion points at various people in turn,
but each of them proves his innocence. Finally Fleming Stone,
the detective who figured in a previous detective story by this
author, is called in to match his wits against those of a particularly
astute villain. Needless to say that in the end right
triumphs.</p>
